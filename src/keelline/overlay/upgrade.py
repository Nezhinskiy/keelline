"""Refresh an overlay after a release, and name the two files nobody may refresh silently.

The refresh itself is C2's, unchanged: an untouched skeleton file is updated, a hand-edited one
is skipped and named, and the oracle is the digest the manifest recorded. An overlay is where
the owner's own rules live, so a silent overwrite here destroys the only copy of something —
which is exactly why this lane calls the engine rather than reimplementing the rule.

**Why a wrapper type rather than a bare `Plan`.** §6.1 gives two files an exception to the hash
rule: `common/claude/permissions.json` and `common/claude/hooks.json` are named *regardless of
hash*, because they are the two that can grant capability and a hash match is not consent for
those. C2's `Plan` has no verb for "needs a decision" and C2 is frozen for this plan, so the
answer is a type *around* the plan rather than a new `Verb` inside it.

**What `decisions` actually is, stated plainly because an earlier account of it was not.** The
write is **unconditional**: `apply()` runs before `decisions` is computed, so there is no moment
at which a decision could be taken and nothing here waits on one. `decisions` is a *post-hoc
notice* — these two files were refreshed, go and look at them — and not a gate.

That is safe for exactly one reason, and it is a property of the shipped template rather than of
this function: the template cannot grant anything. `common/claude/permissions.json` ships a
`permissions` table with no rule in it at all and `common/claude/hooks.json` is `{"hooks": {}}`,
held by `tests/overlay/test_template.py::test_the_template_ships_no_allow_rule_anywhere`,
`::test_the_template_ships_permissions_that_are_neither_granted_nor_pretended` and
`::test_the_template_ships_no_hook_entry`, the first with a mutation behind it. So refreshing
either file can widen nothing, and a notice is enough.

The permissions file used to ship two `deny` rules, and this paragraph used to call it
"deny-only" as though that were the reason it was inert. It was not: `attach.permissions`
reads `permissions.allow` and never `permissions.deny`, so those two rules reached nothing, and
the live copy of that protection is `presets/recommended.toml`'s `[deny] global`, which `setup`
merges into `<home>/.claude/settings.json`. The file is inert because it grants nothing, which
is the property this argument actually needs.

**It stops being enough the day a third capability file lands** — or the day one of those two
ships a non-empty body. A lane that adds one has to move the ask in front of `apply()`, or give
the caller a way to decline; this paragraph is the record that the current shape depends on the
template being inert, and not on the order of the two statements below.

    **`root` is checked to be an overlay before anything is planned, let alone written.** It was
    checked nowhere: in a directory holding a `README.md` and a `src/main.py`, `overlay upgrade
    --root .` created fourteen of the overlay's fifteen files — both manifests,
    `hooks/hooks.json`, `common/**`, `.gitignore` and `.github/workflows/scan.yml`; the
    fifteenth, `README.md`, was skipped only because that directory had one — printed
    `14 to create` and exited 0. Writing
    a workflow file into a repository the owner may then commit is the concrete harm, and
    `--root` defaulting to `.` is what made it a plausible typo rather than an exotic one. The
    probe is `identity.require_overlay`, the same one `setup --overlay` records a root through:
    one question, asked one way, in the one module that knows what an overlay is.

    `decisions` is computed after `apply()` and names the two capability files unconditionally;
    it is a notice, not a gate. The module docstring says why that is safe here and what would
    make it unsafe.

    `project.name` is the instance's directory name and goes nowhere: the engine reads
    `keelline.profile` and `artifacts.local` out of a `Config` and nothing else. It is passed
    because a `Config` has to be complete, not because an overlay is a project.

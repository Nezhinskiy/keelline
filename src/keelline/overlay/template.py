"""Where the shipped overlay tree is, and what `plan()` is handed for it.

`templates/overlay/` lives **under the module root**, beside `presets/`, and for the same
reason: it is read at *runtime* — `overlay create --local` renders it — so the copy that has to
answer is the one an installed Keelline carries. The plugin root's layout draws the tree at the
plugin root, and this repository has already departed from that drawing once, for
`presets/recommended.toml`, which `load_preset` reads out of the package. Two facts settle it
here. `uv_build` has no wheel includes at all: "all data files must either be under the module
root or in the appropriate data directory", so `source-include` reaches the sdist and nothing
else. And `--local` is the fallback for an unreachable template repository, while the skills
reference the CLI by name — so the copy that runs is the one on `PATH`, and a fallback absent
from the wheel is not a fallback.
`hooks/` stays at the plugin root, because the *harness* reads it from there and Python never
does.

`template_root()` is still a function rather than a constant, because `resources.files` is what
answers for an installed package and a checkout alike. **There is no checkout fallback**, and
that is the point of the move: an earlier revision carried one, copying the scaffold engine's
checkout probe, since deleted, and its `parents[3]` arithmetic into this area — a second
spelling of one rule, across two areas, and after the move an unreachable one. A source
checkout is an `src/` layout, so `resources.files("keelline")` answers `src/keelline` there and
the tree is under it; there is no arrangement left in which the package probe misses and a
repository-root walk would have found it.

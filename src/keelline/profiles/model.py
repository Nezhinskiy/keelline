"""A stack profile as data, and the three words its checks are written in.

A profile is what Keelline knows about one stack: which files say a repository is written in it
(`detect`), which paths its rules are about (`scope`), the prose (`rules.md`), the lines every
agent must have before its first command (`essentials`, the bullets of one marked section of
that prose), and the static checks `assess` runs. Nothing here knows which stack. Adding a
language adds a directory beside the shipped ones.

A shipped profile is Keelline's own data. A fault in one is a defect in the build: it raises
`ProfileError` naming what is wrong, and is never skipped. A check that silently vanished would
read as a repository passing it.

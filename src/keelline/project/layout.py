"""Every file `templates/project/` ships; the tree and the list are two statements of one
thing, held each way round by a test.

A name here that no file answers to makes `read` refuse at runtime, and a file here that no
name covers ships in the wheel unseen — `tests/project/test_templates.py` walks the tree with
`rglob` and compares both directions, and `scripts/check_artifacts.py` reads this list to ask
the built wheel the same question.

"""What `init`, `upgrade` and `uninstall` do with the footprint `project_templates` builds, before
the engine plans it.

`project.templates` builds templates from a configuration and decides nothing about a manifest.
This module is the lifecycle policy the three commands apply to what it builds: where
`[artifacts] local` may not move an artifact, which recorded artifacts a configuration retires,
and the order of the footprint pass. `prepare` applies all of it in one sequence, because the
rules arrived one entry point at a time and a command that spelled the sequence out again could
leave one behind. What it returns, `Passes`, is also the one way a command plans those passes,
for the same reason: the ownership relation and the ignore guard came to each command by hand,
and a plan made without the first passed every test but one command's.

"""The one seam between Keelline and the programs it launches.

Everything the areas that launch a program (`overlay`, `attach`, `doctor`, `setup`, and the
release commands) do that leaves this process — asking GitHub for a repository, cloning
one, installing a commit hook — goes through `Runner.run`, so a test asserts *the argv it would
have run* against a stub instead of shelling out to `gh`, `git` or `pre-commit`. Mocking
`subprocess.run` would hide the argv, which is the only part of these calls that can be wrong in
a way a user notices: a missing `--private` publishes somebody's private overlay.

A missing binary is a finding, never a traceback (the global constraints make `gh`, `git` and
`pre-commit` optional), so an `OSError` from the launch becomes `Completed(NOT_FOUND, ...)` and
the caller turns it into a note. A binary that ran and never returned gets its own code,
`TIMED_OUT`, because "not installed" and "hung for five minutes" are different findings.

NOT_FOUND = 127
# `timeout(1)`'s own code, and a separate one on purpose. `TimeoutExpired` is a
# `SubprocessError`, so a `gh` that hung for the full `NETWORK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` used to arrive
# as `NOT_FOUND` -- which every caller reads as "gh is not installed". A wrong finding is worse
# than a slow one, and the two states have different remedies.
TIMED_OUT = 124
# Wall-clock bound on one call, and deliberately far wider than `gitenv.GIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
# (a named cap, not a config key). That one bounds a local, argument-free query that neither
# touches the network nor grows with the repository; every call here does the opposite — `gh
# repo create --clone` waits on GitHub to generate a repository from a template, and the clone
# that follows comes down the wire. Tune this for a hung process, not for a slow link.
NETWORK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 300
# Inherit the environment rather than scrub it: these are the machine owner's own authenticated
# commands, and `gh` needs its token and `git` its ssh-agent to work at all. What is dropped is
# what points git at a *different* repository, or a different index or object store, than the
# directory it was given -- which is exactly what a clone into a fresh directory must not
# inherit. `gitenv.scrubbed_env()` reaches the same end from the other side, with a five-key
# allowlist; this seam cannot, because the owner's own authentication is the point of it.
#
# **This list is a trade-off and is not exhaustive, and the comment that said it was the two
# that redirect git was wrong.** `GH_HOST` and `GH_CONFIG_DIR` redirect `gh` the same way and
# are kept deliberately: they are how a GitHub Enterprise owner reaches their own host, and
# dropping them would break that installation outright to close a gap the inherited token does
# not have. A lane that needs them gone should say which call and why.

# from a hang. What makes that a finding rather than an annoyance is which callers reach the
# network through here: `overlay create --template` launches `gh repo create` and a clone, whose
# authentication is the machine owner's and which prompts when it is missing, and
# `release.pins.released` runs `git ls-remote` against the public repository for `keelline init`
# and for `doctor`'s `ci-ref` row -- a write meant to run non-interactively and a read-only
# diagnostic, neither of them something a person is sitting in front of waiting to type a
# password.
#
# **This used to say the `ci-ref` row resolves a repository-authored URL, and it does not.** That
# row has asked about `keelline.REPOSITORY_URL`, a module constant, since the wave-4 lane that
# gave it one. The control is unchanged and still needed; what was wrong was the sentence
# explaining it, which named the one caller it had stopped applying to -- and a false rationale on
# a hardening is how a later lane concludes the hardening is unnecessary.

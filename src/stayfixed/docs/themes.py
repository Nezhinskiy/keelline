"""A `trail.toml` theme's `pattern`: the part of regular-expression syntax a filename filter needs,
matched without backtracking.

A theme's `pattern` is repository-authored, and `re`'s backtracking turns a pattern such as
`(a+)+$` exponential on a name of forty characters, so under `re` `stayfixed docs trail`, the
`trail` gate and `stayfixed assess` would never finish. The language kept here is a subset of
the regular expressions such files already hold, with the meaning `re.search` gives them on a
name of one line: literal text, `.` for any one character, `.*` for any run of them, `|`
between alternatives, `^` and `$` at an alternative's two ends, and `\\` before a punctuation
character to take it literally.
A name holding a newline is compared without `re`'s newline rules — here `.` matches a newline
and `$` is only the name's very end — and none reaches a theme: the listing refuses a document
whose name is not a single line before it asks which theme the name is in.
The shipped `.*` and patterns such as `widget` and `gadget|gizmo` mean what they meant; anything
else — a group, a class, another quantifier — is refused rather than guessed at.

**Why it cannot backtrack.** An alternative is a run of fixed-length pieces separated by `.*`.
Placing each piece at its leftmost fit after the one before leaves the longest rest for the ones
after it, so the leftmost fit is the only placement worth trying, and a match is one left-to-right
pass: at most the name's length times the pattern's, whatever either holds.

**Why a pattern has a length bound.** That product is still the repository's to choose: a match
costs up to the name's length times the pattern's, so an unbounded pattern could hold the `trail`
gate for seconds per name, and a `trail.toml` of such patterns past its job's time limit.
`PATTERN_MAX_CHARS` bounds each pattern, and `docs.trail` bounds how many themes a file may hold,
since every name is tried against every theme until one matches.

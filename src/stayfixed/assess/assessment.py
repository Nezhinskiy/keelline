"""What stands between a repository, as it is, and enforcement: every configured gate and every
probe, as one inventory.

**The tree's own configuration.** The question is about this tree, so `assess` reads the tree's
`stayfixed.toml` and is not a trust boundary: what a clone configures is what a person running
it asked to see judged, the way running its test suite runs the tests it carries.

**Compute everything, then write once.** Every gate and probe runs before the one write, so a
run that stops part-way leaves the last finished inventory in place rather than half of a new
one.

The file is read through `load`, which refuses a `stayfixed.toml` that is a symlink, as every
command does: a clone's link to `/dev/zero` would otherwise end the run by exhausting memory.

**One write, at a constant place.** The inventory goes to `ASSESSMENT`, stayfixed's own spelling
of the path `stayfixed uninstall` takes back, and no configured value can move it: the loader
refuses a `[paths]` value inside stayfixed's directory. What a clone can do is put something
there — a symlinked `.stayfixed`, or a directory at the file's place — and each is a refusal
with nothing written. A symlink at the file's place is replaced by the file and its target is
left as it was, because the replacement is a rename, which never follows a link at its
destination.

**Counts in the summary, the rest in the document.** A gate's reason, a custom gate's output
and every item's `where` can carry what a repository authored, so `render` prints counts and
stayfixed's own words — gate names, probe and rule ids, severities, remedies — and the whole
list goes to the file and `--json`, which are one serialisation (`document`).

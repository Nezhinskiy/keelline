## stayfixed

This repository is initialised with stayfixed. `stayfixed.toml` names its document paths and
its note store. `%%BUG_INDEX%%` is a generated index over `%%BUGS%%/` — never edit it by hand;
`stayfixed bugs index` renders it. `%%ROADMAP%%` carries the design-and-plan trail between its
markers, which `stayfixed docs trail` rewrites; specs live under `%%SPECS%%/` and plans under
`%%PLANS%%/`. Each gate runs advisory until it enforces: `stayfixed adopt promote` enforces the
gates that pass, and `stayfixed assess` says which would.%%PROFILE%%

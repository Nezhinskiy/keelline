name: attach
description: Bind a repository to its private memory overlay and link the note store in, or detach it. Use when a session reports "not attached", a memory path is a real directory, or the user asks to attach or detach the overlay.

# Attaching the overlay

`PATH` below is always `<overlay>/projects/<project name>/memory`, where the name is the
`[project] name` in this repository's `keelline.toml`. Any other path is refused: the overlay
root comes from the machine configuration, not from what is typed here.

1. Run `keelline attach --store PATH --check` first. It reports whether the overlay's record
   binds this repository's remote, and which allow rules and hook entries would be added. It
   writes nothing. If the report counts memory groups that are real directories, stop: the
   notes have to move into the overlay first — each group to
   `<overlay>/projects/<name>/memory/<group>`, the shared group to `common/memory`. Say the
   count and wait; moving notes is the owner's act, never yours.
2. Relay that diff to the user and wait for an answer. The command itself refuses to widen a
   permission without `--yes`, so this step is how a person comes to give it — not what stands
   in for it. Once they agree, run `keelline attach --store PATH --yes`; it merges the rules,
   links the notes into this checkout and every worktree, and prints what it wrote. An overlay
   that grants nothing attaches without the flag, and that is the command's decision rather
   than a judgement to make here.
3. If the report says `mismatch`, stop. The overlay recorded a different remote under this
   project's name, so this may not be the repository it was bound to. Say so, and pass
   `keelline attach --store PATH --trust-remote` only after the user confirms that this
   repository is the one that should be bound.
4. `keelline detach` removes the merged rules, the Codex rule files, the note links and the
   local ledger, and leaves the binding record in the overlay untouched. Relay what it removed.
5. Personal rules, notes and permissions live in the overlay and nowhere else. Never copy one
   into the project repository, and never widen a permission on the user's behalf.

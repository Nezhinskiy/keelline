# --- the descriptor walk, which had no coverage at all ---------------------------------------

# `open_within` is what the module leads with, and `write_atomically_at` is the sole write path
# of the scaffold engine. Neither was exercised by any test, which is how a call that raises
# NotImplementedError on Linux passed a green suite on macOS: the platform difference only
# shows where the code actually runs.

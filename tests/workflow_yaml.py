"""A strict reader for the YAML subset this repository's workflows are written in.

The repository carries no YAML parser, and the suite imports only what the runtime does plus its
declared development tools, so the workflow tests used to read `check.yml` by line pattern — one
pattern per question. Each of those readers could stop early or skip a line: an `env:` reader
that ended at the first comment left every key after it unread, and a step walk that knew two
spellings of a step folded a third into the step above it. So there is one reader, and it reads
the whole file into mappings, lists and strings, or fails.

**The subset, and the rule for everything outside it.** Block mappings of plain keys, block
sequences, plain scalars on one line, double- and single-quoted scalars on one line, flow
sequences of such scalars (`[main]`), literal block scalars (`|`, `|-`), and comments — a
comment line at any indentation, and one after a value past a space. Anything else is refused
with the line it is on: a flow mapping, an anchor, an alias, a tag, a folded scalar, a key that
is quoted or repeated in its mapping, a plain scalar that continues on the next line, a tab in
the indentation, a line indented where nothing can own it, a sequence at its key's own
indentation, an empty block scalar, a document that does not start at column 0. A refusal is a
red test in front of whoever wrote the shape, which is the safe direction; a reader that skipped
the shape would report clean over it.

**How YAML ends a block, and this reader with it.** A block ends at the first line of content
that is not indented past its key: a comment never ends one, whatever its indentation, and a
blank line never does. A literal block scalar's indentation is its first non-blank line's, and
it ends at the first non-blank line indented less, comment or not.

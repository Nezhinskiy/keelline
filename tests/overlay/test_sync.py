"""What `overlay_sync` reports about the overlay's own repository, and why it declares no mutation.

**No `mutations.toml` entry for this module, stated rather than left silent.** Every value here
comes from `git` itself under constant arguments — `status --porcelain` and
`rev-list --count @{upstream}..HEAD`, in the overlay root this machine recorded — and nothing
downstream reads the answer as permission: `attach/hooks.py` turns it into one session line and
`doctor` into one row, both advisory, and neither gates an exit code or a write. Its two guards
are `code != 0 -> asked=False`, which keeps "git could not be asked" apart from "there is nothing
to report" and which the last case below asserts, and `isdigit()` before `int()`, which keeps a
reader that must answer for every input from raising into a handler whose backstop would take the
whole result with it. `mutations.toml` is for load-bearing guards — a containment check, a trust
gate, a refusal something reads as permission — and breaking either of these costs a line of a
nudge, so there is none here.

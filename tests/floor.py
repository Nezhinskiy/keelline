"""The floor the suite puts under every `git` the product runs, in a test's own process and in
every `keelline` a test starts as a separate one.

`tests/conftest.py` sets `gitenv.FLOOR_VARIABLE` in this process's environment for every test.
A spawner that starts from `os.environ` takes `developer_free_environ()`, which drops the
developer's own harness and Keelline variables and keeps the floor, so it cannot get the one
without the other. A spawner that builds its child's environment from nothing adds
`floor_env()`. A test about a bound running out removes the variable, and its children then get
none either.

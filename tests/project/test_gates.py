"""A bare repository `init --yes` has just written passes every gate the workflow runs.

The fixture guard beside this one says the committed fixture is what the templates render; this
one says the templates render a project the gates accept, which is a different claim and the
one a first adopter meets. The five invocations are the five built-in gates `keelline gate` runs
in `.github/workflows/check.yml`, driven through their own commands and the real parser the way
`tests/test_fixtures.py` drives them.

"""The `docs` and `trail` gates judge tracked files: `assess` says when a file one of them reads
is not, and `adopt promote` never enforces such a gate.

CI checks out what git tracks and nothing else, so a file those gates read here and git does not
track is one they read here and CI never sees; there the gate's own finding for an absent file
fails every pull request. Each case starts from the smoke fixture, where every file is tracked
and every gate passes, and takes one file out of git's index while leaving it on disk.

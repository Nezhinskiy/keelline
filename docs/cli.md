# Command reference

Every command, what it reads, what it writes, and what each exit code means. `keelline --help`
gives you the one-line version; this is the rest.

Three things hold everywhere:

- **`--json` is accepted anywhere** and prints one machine-readable object instead of one line.
  It is not declared per command — the frame strips it from `argv` before parsing.
- **Exit codes**: `0` success, `1` findings, `2` a refusal or an internal error. A caller that
  treats `1` as "proceed anyway" must still never treat `2` that way — a refusal is a boundary,
  not a low-confidence result.
- **Every `memory` command takes the same three options**, described once here rather than five
  times below.

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--root PATH` | The project root. Default: the current directory. |
| `--store PATH` | Resolve the note store at this path instead of where the configuration says. An override of *where the notes are*, not of the rules about them: the same containment and overlay-binding checks apply, so it is not a way around the trust gate. |
| `--machine PATH` | Read this machine configuration file instead of `~/.config/keelline/config.toml`. Mostly for tests and for running against a second machine profile; it also decides which `trust.json` is consulted. |

## `keelline memory index`

Rewrite every note's `index:` line and re-render `MEMORY.md` from them.

```bash
keelline memory index            # write
keelline memory index --check    # report drift, write nothing
```

**Reads** every `*.md` under each configured group, and the current `MEMORY.md`.
**Writes** each note whose `index:` line it filled in, and `MEMORY.md` — in overlay mode, the
file the symlink points at, not the link.

What it does, in order:

1. **Harvests.** A second writer — you, another session — may have appended
   `- [trigger → answer](group/note.md)` lines to `MEMORY.md`. Those are read back into each
   note's `index:` frontmatter first, so nothing a session wrote is lost by regenerating.
2. **Invents what is missing.** A note with no `index:` gets a provisional one from its
   `description`. Provisional lines are reported so you can curate them.
3. **Renders.** One section per configured group, a note's `group:` value as a sub-heading
   inside it, ordered by `startup` rank first, then by `group_order`, then by name — so a
   note ranked for the session leads its section whatever its position within a sub-heading.

`--check` exits `1` when the index has drifted, when it is over its word budget, when it is past
the harness's line or byte caps, or when a file in the store cannot be parsed as a note. The
same findings are printed on the write path too — they just do not fail it, because `--check`
is the mode that fails a build.

Exits `2` if `MEMORY.md` is a symlink this store may not follow (see §9.1's target rule: outside
overlay mode a symlinked index is refused outright; in overlay mode only a link into *this*
project's own share of the recorded overlay is honoured).

**Trust interacts with this command**, and the interaction is the non-obvious part: `memory
index` rewrites the very files the trust hash covers, so it would revoke the approval it depends
on. It does not — it re-records the hash across exactly the files it itself wrote, carrying every
other file's approved digest forward unchanged. If something else changed the store while the
command ran, it refuses to carry trust and says so.

## `keelline memory trust --in-repo-memory`

Record that the notes this repository committed may reach the model.

The flag is required and never read: it is a confirmation gesture, not a switch, and it is what
stops this from being a bare, trivially scripted command.

**Reads** every file the store yields. **Writes** `~/.config/keelline/trust.json` (or the file
beside `--machine`).

The hash covers every note, `MEMORY.md`, and the repository-controlled configuration rendered
into it, keyed by the store's absolute path. Change any of it and the approval lapses — you are
asked again rather than silently kept. Notes that are *yours* (an overlay store) need no
approval; recording one is inert rather than dangerous.

Exits `2` if `trust.json` exists and does not parse. It holds every project's approval on the
machine, so nothing will overwrite a file it could not read — repair or delete it.

## `keelline memory session-context --bundle <name> [--part N]`

Render one injection bundle. This is what a `SessionStart` hook entry invokes; you will rarely
run it by hand except to see what a session actually receives.

| Bundle | What it is |
|---|---|
| `preset-rules` | Rules from your own preset. Never repository content, so never gated. |
| `standing-rules` | Every note flagged `startup`, in full, ranked. Never truncated — only flagged when the set outgrows its budget, because a standing rule that does not arrive is a standing rule that gets broken. |
| `volatile-notes` | Dated, perishable notes, in full; over budget, descriptions only. |
| `index` | `MEMORY.md` itself, so the model can route. |

Each bundle is emitted across numbered parts, because the harness caps each hook entry's output
independently. `--part N` selects one; a part past the end prints nothing and exits `0`. A part
that is a single block too large for one slot is withheld — the command prints a short notice
saying so instead, because the harness would otherwise truncate it and a truncated region loses
the marker that says where repository content ends. `keelline memory fit` names the block.

Output is deliberately **raw**, not JSON: the margin that keeps a bundle inside the platform cap
is additive only because there is no envelope and no escaping. Do not pass `--json` from a hook
entry.

When the store is repository data with no trust record, every bundle but `preset-rules` is
empty, and this command says nothing rather than explaining why — its output *is* what reaches
the model. `keelline memory index` and `keelline memory fit` are where the explanation is
printed, because those are the commands a person runs.

## `keelline memory inventory`

What a memory sweep reads: every note with its word count, type, `startup` rank, date, whether
it is stale, and whether its index line is curated, harvested or provisional. Plus totals.

Writes nothing.

## `keelline memory fit`

Whether each bundle fits the numbered hook entries declared for it. Exits `1` when one does not
— either it needs more parts than there are slots, or a single block is larger than one part
and would be truncated by the platform.

A bundle that fits because it is *empty* is not a bundle that fits, so the output also reports
whether the trust gate is open.

Writes nothing.

## `keelline release check`

Cross-checks the version across `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `src/keelline/__init__.py`, both
plugin manifests and `CHANGELOG.md`. Exits `1` naming every source that disagrees.

This is discipline for **the Keelline repository itself**, not something Keelline offers your
project. See [RELEASING.md](../RELEASING.md).

## `keelline hook <event>`

Internal. Reads a hook payload on stdin, dispatches it to every handler registered for that
event, and writes the harness's expected output.

Not something to run by hand. Its exit-code policy differs from every other command: an internal
error refuses (`2`) only on `PreToolUse`, and degrades open (`0`) everywhere else — on
`UserPromptSubmit` an exit `2` erases what you typed, so a bug in Keelline must not cost you
your prompt.

## `keelline guard bg-cleanup`

Judge one Bash call for a background leak. Reads one JSON object on stdin — a whole hook
payload, or a bare `tool_input` with `command` and `run_in_background` — and answers `2` when
the call would be refused (a `&`-backgrounded job with no `trap … EXIT`, or a backgrounded
command that begins with `sleep`), `1` when it carries a trailing restore no trap protects, and
`0` otherwise. Both refusals need `run_in_background` to be `true` in the object you send —
the leak and the `sleep` are only faults for a job the harness will not reap, so a CI smoke
test written without that key measures `0` on a command that is refused in a session.
Anything it cannot read is `2`: this is the fail-closed row of the CLI table, and a guard that
guessed would be guessing. That is about the JSON, not about the command inside it: a command
longer than the 64 KiB cap is not read either, and is allowed (`0`) rather than refused,
because tokenizing an unbounded string in front of every Bash call is the larger fault.

This is the same judgement the `PreToolUse` `Bash` hook makes; the command exists so a CI
smoke test and a person can ask it without a harness. **Writes** nothing.

## `keelline commit check --range RANGE`

Every message in `RANGE` (a `git log` revision range, e.g. `main..HEAD`), for lines in its
trailing attribution block that are an AI/tool attribution trailer or footer: a `-by:` trailer
whose address is at a vendor's domain or whose name is a product, a `Generated with <tool>`
footer, or a line that is only `AI-generated`. The block is the message's last paragraph plus
every paragraph above it that is attribution to the last line — the canonical harness block is
two paragraphs — and it ends at the first paragraph holding any body line. Body prose is never
judged, and a person whose name happens to be a vendor word is not a violation.
`[commit_messages] attribution_check = false` stops the rules being applied: no message is ever
a violation, but the range must still be readable, because the report says how many messages it
read. Exits `1` naming each offence as `sha line N [label]` — never the text, which is the
repository's — and `2` when git cannot read the range or the range looks like an option.
**Writes** nothing. This is what the reusable workflow runs.

Exit `1` has two meanings here and a gate should know both: messages were read and some carry a
trailer (`FAIL: …`), and *no `keelline.toml` was found under `--root`*, which the configuration
loader reports as a failure — `keelline: failed: …/keelline.toml does not exist` — and not as a
refusal. A workflow that must tell them apart reads the first word of the output, or checks the
file is there before it runs the gate.

## `keelline commit strip FILE`

Rewrite a commit-message file in place with the attribution lines of its trailing attribution
block removed — never a line of the body. Exits `0` whether or not anything was stripped, and
says which; a message that is *only* attribution is left alone, because emptying it aborts the
commit with a confusing error and CI explains better. Refuses a symlink, and fails (`1`) on a
file it cannot read, a file that is not UTF-8 included.

Git's own trailing comment block is kept, and so is everything below the scissors line that
`commit.verbose = true` puts the staged diff under — the message is what lies above both.

This is what the chained `prepare-commit-msg` hook runs, so the trailer is gone before the
commit exists; `git commit --no-verify` skips `commit-msg` but not that hook. Installing the
hook is a library call today (`keelline.guards.api.install`) — no `keelline` subcommand offers
it yet. **Writes** `FILE`.

## `keelline test hygiene`

The two environment faults that make a red test run unattributable: uncommitted changes in
the tree, and `.pyc` files whose recorded source mtime no longer matches their source. Counts
the bytecode under `[ledger] code_roots` and the uncommitted changes across the whole
repository — a dirty tree anywhere makes a red run unattributable — and exits `1` when either
is present, `2` when git cannot report the tree. The `PostToolUse` `Bash` hook delivers the
same note once per context after a red pytest run. **Writes** nothing.

## `keelline test audit-entrypoints`

Tests that never exercise what they name, in two shapes: an assertion whose value is produced
by invoking a test double, and a test whose name states an entry point it imports but never
mentions again, in its own body or in the local helpers it reaches. Scans every `test_*.py`
under `[ledger] code_roots`, treating the packages and modules found directly under those
roots as the code under test. Candidates are for triage: the command exits `0` and lists them in
`--json`, **with findings and no way to fail on them** — that is deliberate, not an oversight,
and nothing here gates. Run over a repository's own suite the scanner names name-collision
candidates that are not defects, so an exit `1` would be red from the first run, and the
configuration has no per-command switch to turn it off with. Gating belongs to a lane that has
triaged them to zero, and that lane has not shipped. Refuses (`2`) if its own self-test no
longer discriminates. **Writes** nothing.

The `--json` object carries `summary` (the line the command would have printed), `files` (how
many test files were scanned), `import_roots` (the
top-level names treated as the code under test) and `findings`, sorted by path then line. Each
finding is `path`, `line`, `test` (the test function's name), `shape` (`assert-on-double` or
`names-but-never-invokes`) and `detail`. These keys are the contract; `path`, `test` and
`detail` are repository-authored strings, which is why they are in `--json` and not in the
summary line.

## `keelline bugs new TITLE --severity S --area A [--source S] [--related ID …] [--no-fetch]`

File a bug: allocate the next free identifier (`1 + max` over every entry in the working tree
and every entry ever added on any ref, after a bounded `git fetch origin` unless `--no-fetch`),
write `<paths.bugs>/<PREFIX>-nnn.md` from the template, and regenerate the index. Every
rejection happens before the first write: a title or source the flat frontmatter subset cannot
hold is quoted for you; a `--related` value that is not an identifier, an index carrying content
this tool did not generate (`2`), and an allocated identifier whose file already exists (`1`,
naming `bugs check`) each leave the tree exactly as it was. A skipped fetch is reported on the
result line, not hidden. **Writes** the entry file and `<paths.bug_index>`.

## `keelline bugs index [--check]`

Render `<paths.bug_index>` from the entry files alone. `--check` exits `1` when the committed
index differs from that rendering and writes nothing. Either form refuses (`2`) while the write
would destroy something: a line the index holds that this tool did not generate (a hand-written
section, an operator's note — recover it into an entry file first), or a generated index whose
entry directory is gone (restore the files; the index carries nothing of its own). A reworded
header is a stale index, not foreign content. The first paragraph names the generator, and an
index written by the generator this one replaced is recognised as generated too. **Writes**
`<paths.bug_index>`.

## `keelline bugs check`

Every rule the ledger holds, in one pass: each entry parses under the flat frontmatter subset
and its `id:` matches its filename; no entry restates `**Status:**`/`**Severity:**` in its
body; every severity in `[ledger] evidence_boundary_required_for` carries a filled `**What this
evidence does not establish:**` line (the template's placeholder does not count); no identifier
is claimed by two files; every `related:` identifier has an entry; the index carries nothing
this tool did not generate, and is current; every `<PREFIX>-nnn` mentioned under the top-level
files and `[ledger] code_roots` has an entry (a `void` entry counts); every citation of an entry
*file* — from those roots and from the directories the `[paths]` values live under — names a
file that exists. Exits `1` with the count and up to eight `path:line [rule]` labels on the
line; `--json` carries every problem with its `detail`, which may quote the repository and is
why it is not on the line. Before a ledger exists — no `[paths] bugs` directory *and* no
generated index — prints `nothing to check` and exits `0`; a generated index with no directory
behind it is a deleted ledger and exits `1`. Git enumerates the files where the root is the top
of a checkout (tracked plus untracked-not-ignored), and a walk stands in elsewhere. A file whose
first 2 KiB carry `keelline:ledger:fixtures` holds sample identifiers and is neither scanned nor
swept. **Writes** nothing.

## `keelline bugs renumber OLD NEW`

Move an entry to a free identifier: `NEW` gets the entry with its `id:` rewritten, `OLD` becomes
a `void` pointer at the new number, every scanned file that mentions `OLD` is rewritten, and the
index is regenerated — both endpoints first, then the sweep, so an interruption leaves `OLD`
resolving to the pointer rather than to nothing. Refuses an occupied `NEW` or a missing `OLD`
(`1`) and the index refusals of `bugs index` (`2`) before touching anything. A file the sweep
could not read or write is listed and the command exits `1` naming it, because once the pointer
exists a stale mention in that file looks intentional to `bugs check` forever. The moved entry's
own body is the operator's to rewrite and is not swept. **Writes** the two entry files, every
rewritten file, and `<paths.bug_index>`.

## Configuration

`keelline.toml` in the project root, committed. Every value is repository-controlled, which is
why so few of them are trusted with anything.

```toml
[keelline]
version = "0.1.0"
state = "installed"
preset = "recommended"
profile = ""
agents = ["claude", "codex"]

[project]
name = "widget"          # one lowercase path segment
base_branch = "main"
release_branch = "main"

[paths]
memory = "docs/memory"   # and the other document paths; each must stay inside the root

[memory]
mode = "local-only"      # local-only | in-repo | overlay
groups = ["developer", "project-stable", "project-volatile", "specs"]
index_extra = []         # extra pointers rendered into MEMORY.md

[budgets]                # a project may lower a preset's budget, never raise it
memory_index_words = 1200
startup_rules_words = 1600
volatile_notes_words = 2500
volatile_ttl_days = 30
```

`~/.config/keelline/config.toml` is yours, not the project's:

```toml
[personal]
reply_language = ""      # chat replies; durable artifacts stay in the artifact language
artifact_language = "en"

[overlay]
root = "~/keelline-overlay"   # only read in overlay mode
```

**This file's location is not selectable by a repository.** The path is
`~/.config/keelline/config.toml`, and neither `KEELLINE_CONFIG` nor `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` changes
it: a committed `.claude/settings.json` `env` block would otherwise choose your overlay root
and your trust record. Pass `--machine <path>` to read a different file — a path you typed
rather than one an environment chose, and honoured by every reader of it.

Only `[overlay]` and the trust record used to be held to that rule while `[personal]` followed
the environment, so one command could read the two halves of this file out of two different
files: `[personal]` honoured, and the overlay silently unrecorded a few lines below it.

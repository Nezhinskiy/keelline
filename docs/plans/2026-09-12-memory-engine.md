# Memory Engine Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development
> (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use
> checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

> **Tasks 1–9 were executed before they were written down.** Those modules and tests were
> materialised into a scratch tree on the shipped foundation, run, and taken to green: **422
> tests pass across both wave-2 contract lanes, `ruff check` is clean and `mypy --strict`
> reports no issues.** The note reader was additionally swept over a real 72-note store:
> **71 of 71 parsed notes round-trip byte for byte.** The `Expected: N passed` lines are counts
> from `pytest --collect-only` on that tree.
>
> **Tasks 10–12 are ports and were not executed.** They say so in their own headers, name the
> source to port from, and carry the gating their sources lack. Do not read them as the same
> kind of document as the tasks above.

**Goal:** Build the memory store (contract C3) — resolution, the note schema, index rendering
with reconciliation, the injection bundles and their budgets, worktree links, and the `memory`
command group — so that a project's working memory travels between machines and a hostile
clone cannot reach, replace or impersonate it.

**Architecture:** `src/keelline/memory/` is a full area: `commands.py` registers the `memory`
group the CLI frame discovers, and `hooks.py` returns the handlers the hook registry
discovers. The store is resolved once per invocation and passed down; no module below
`store.py` guesses where notes live. Frontmatter is parsed by a restricted reader rather than
a YAML library, because the runtime is stdlib-only — and that reader keeps the *lines* a note
arrived as, rewriting only the keys a run actually changed, so two writers can share one
directory without reformatting each other's work.

**Tech Stack:** Python ≥ 3.11, standard library only at runtime (`re`, `json`, `hashlib`,
`secrets`, `datetime`, `pathlib`, `subprocess`, `os`, `tomllib`, `dataclasses`, `enum`),
pytest, ruff, mypy strict.

**Spec:** the agent-harness extraction design, at the source's spec path — a private repository; it cannot be opened from this one — §5.2 (the
Memory row of the CLI table), §5.3 (which events these handlers serve), §6.2 and §6.3 (the
overlay's layout and the tree `attach` creates), §9.1–§9.5 (the whole memory contract), §11
(what migrates and the `common/ → projects/` link rule), §12 (the hostile-clone rows), §15.2
(the `memory-engine` row), §15.4 (contracts C3 and C4). That document lives in a private
repository and cannot be opened from this one; every clause this plan leans on is quoted where
it is used.

**Scope:** package `memory-engine` (§15.2). Produces C3; consumes C1 (`keelline.config`) and
C4 (`keelline.hooks.api`). A change belongs to this plan iff it lands under
`src/keelline/memory/`, `tests/memory/`, the two foundation files Task 1 names, or the
changelog fragment in Task 13. `hooks/hooks.json`, `hooks/run-hook.sh`, the per-harness emitter
and the durable marker sink belong to `hooks-core`; the content of the notes themselves belongs
to the `notes` lane; the MCP server belongs to `mcp`; `attach` creates the link tree this lane
validates and links into worktrees.

## Global Constraints

Every task's requirements implicitly include this section.

- **Python floor 3.11**; the runtime imports only the standard library and `keelline` itself,
  enforced by `tests/test_import_boundary.py`. **There is no YAML library**: Task 2's reader is
  the only frontmatter parser in the package, and no task may add a dependency.
- **Exit codes (C5):** 0 success, 1 findings or failure, 2 refusal or internal error. Library
  modules raise `keelline.errors.Failure` / `Refusal`; only `cli.py` maps them.
- **Handlers are pure** `(event, config) -> HookResult` with a declared `policy`. Every handler
  in this lane is `Policy.OPEN`: none may block a tool call, and none may raise out of `run`.
- **Nothing in `hooks.py` imports the configuration layer at module scope.**
  `tests/test_areas.py` asserts that `discover()` in a clean interpreter imports neither
  `keelline.config` nor `keelline.presets`, and discovery imports every area's `hooks` module.
  Annotations are strings under `TYPE_CHECKING`; every real import lives inside a handler body.
- **No cross-module test imports.** `tests/` is not a package and there is no `conftest.py`, so
  `from tests.memory.test_x import helper` fails to collect under the bare `pytest` every step
  below invokes. Each test module builds its own fixtures.
- **No magic numbers** (D7): every budget, cap and TTL comes from `config.budgets`,
  `config.native_caps` or a named module constant whose comment says which shipped file must
  change with it.
- **Lint and types:** ruff `line-length = 100`, `select = ["E", "F", "I", "UP", "B", "SIM"]`;
  `mypy` strict over `src`, `tests` and `scripts/keelline`.
- **English artifacts** (D13), and **no project-identifying string** (§5.8): fixtures use
  neutral names (`widget`, `acme`), never an adopting project's name, ledger prefix, phase
  names or document paths.
- **`git` in a test runs with the developer's configuration scrubbed** —
  `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null`, `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM=/dev/null`, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` — and
  every such module is skipped where `git` is absent. `commit.gpgsign`, `core.hooksPath` and
  `init.templateDir` can each hang or fail a commit that has nothing to do with the test.
- **Every command test threads `--machine`.** Without it, `machine_config_path()` resolves to
  the developer's real `~/.config/keelline/`, and `memory trust` writes a trust record into
  their home directory.
- **Assertion oracles:** every new assertion ships with the mutation that reddens it, or a
  sentence saying why none exists. A mutation that was run and did not discriminate is recorded.
- **Writes are enumerated** (D14): this lane writes inside the resolved store, and creates the
  two link trees `worktree.py` owns. Every note, index and trust record goes through
  `fsops.write_atomically`.
- **The `Expected: N passed` lines are measured, not estimated.**
- **Commit per task**, conventional type prefix, no attribution trailer of any kind.

## File Structure

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/keelline/fsops.py`, `src/keelline/config/machine.py` | **Foundation (Task 1)**, shared with the `scaffold` lane |
| `src/keelline/memory/notes.py` | `Note`, the restricted frontmatter reader and the line-preserving writer |
| `src/keelline/memory/store.py` | §9.1 resolution, the link rule, the binding, the worktree fallback |
| `src/keelline/memory/trust.py` | §9.4 trust state and the delimited data marker |
| `src/keelline/memory/index.py` | §9.3 reconciliation and index rendering |
| `src/keelline/memory/bundles.py` | §9.5 bundles, budgets, cap splitting |
| `src/keelline/memory/worktree.py` | The two link trees |
| `src/keelline/memory/inventory.py` | What a memory sweep reads |
| `src/keelline/memory/commands.py` | The `memory` CLI group |
| `src/keelline/memory/hooks.py` | Handler registration, with every heavy import deferred |
| `src/keelline/memory/api.py` | The C3 import surface — a module, not the package `__init__` |
| `src/keelline/memory/routing.py`, `ledger_notes.py`, `refs.py` | **Ports (Tasks 10–12)** |

**Premise (deviations and decisions, for the wave-2 merger):**

- **Task 1 lands two files foundation owns**, and is **identical to the `scaffold` plan's Task
  1**. Whichever lane merges first lands it; the second finds it present, runs the two test
  files, and moves on.
- **The overlay store is a tree of links, not one link.** §6.3 has `attach` create "the
  git-ignored `docs/memory` symlink tree in the project (`MEMORY.md`, `developer` →
  `common/memory`, `project-stable`, `project-volatile`, `specs`)", while §9.1 says overlay mode
  is "a symlink that `attach` created". Those read as a contradiction and are not one: §9.1's
  "a symlink **there**" is a rule about a link *inside* `paths.memory`, applied per link, and
  reading it as a claim that `paths.memory` is itself one link loses `common/memory` entirely —
  the cross-project half of the store, which is shared across projects and by construction
  cannot sit under `projects/<name>/`. §11 sizes that half at 36 of 85 notes. This lane
  implements the tree and applies §9.1's target rule to each link. **`attach` and `notes` both
  depend on this reading**; it is the first thing to confirm at the merge.
- **The four injection bundles are `hooks.json` entries, not dispatcher handlers.** Foundation's
  `hook <event>` takes an event name and runs every handler registered for it, joining their
  contexts and clamping the join to one platform cap. Registering nine numbered slots as
  handlers therefore concatenates them back into a single 10,000-character budget — the exact
  17 KB→2 KB defect §9.5 exists to remove. Invoked as separate entries running
  `memory session-context --bundle X --part N`, each slot gets its own cap **and** the text is
  emitted raw rather than inside a JSON envelope, so `CAP_MARGIN` is genuinely additive instead
  of fighting `ensure_ascii`'s six characters per non-ASCII code point — which matters, because
  §9.2 mandates `trigger → what the note settles` and those arrows are what these bundles are
  made of. **This is the C3/C4 seam and `hooks-core` must be told.** `SLOTS` is the mapping that
  lane writes its entries from, and `memory fit` is what `doctor` reads.
- **The overlay root is read from the machine file by this lane, not by C1.** §9.1 needs it;
  C1's `Personal` carries only three keys and widening it changes a frozen contract. `store.py`
  reads `[overlay] root` directly; `setup` (wave 3) writes that key.
- **`index` provenance is spelled as two top-level keys**, `index:` and `index_provenance:`
  (`curated` when absent). §9.2 says provenance is "recorded when the generator harvested it"
  without fixing a spelling.
- **`group` is a sub-heading, not a section.** Sections come from `[memory] groups`, one per
  folder, titled from the folder name; a note's `group` renders as a `###` inside its folder's
  section. A hand-written section title that is not derivable from its folder name is not
  reproduced, and the `notes` lane inherits that.
- **`memory trust --in-repo-memory` lives in the Memory group.** §5.2 lists `trust` in the
  Project group, which no wave-2 lane opens; the flag keeps the spec's spelling.
- **The `preset-rules` bundle ships no rule text.** §5.6 gives `presets/` to the `setup` lane;
  the bundle renders `preset["rules"]` and emits nothing until that table exists. It is also
  the one bundle with no trust gate: a preset ships with the plugin and is never repository
  content, so gating it would make the owner's own rules hostage to a clone.
- **A C4 gap this lane records rather than works around.** `dispatch` marks a handler's
  `once_key` on *any* successful run, including one that produced no context. For the ledger
  notes (Task 11) that inverts the intent: the first `Bash` call of a session rarely opens the
  ledger, so the key would be marked on an empty result and every later ledger-opening call
  skipped — "at most once, whichever fired first" instead of "once per context". Until
  `hooks-core` marks only on a non-empty result, Task 11 declares no `once_key`, and the notes
  arrive on every matching call. That is the degradation, stated in the direction it actually
  runs.
- **Tasks 10–12 need a checkout of the repository these scripts are ported from**, and this
  plan's own header says that repository cannot be opened from here. That is a real dependency,
  not a footnote: an implementer without it must report the mismatch rather than reimplement
  from the description.

### Task 1: The atomic, containment-preserving writer *(foundation, shared with `scaffold`)*

**Files:**
- Create: `src/keelline/fsops.py`
- Modify: `src/keelline/config/machine.py`
- Test: `tests/test_fsops.py`, `tests/config/test_machine.py`

**If the `scaffold` lane has already merged, this task is a verification, not a change.** Run
Step 4 and move on.

**Why this lane needs it.** §5.4 requires `KEELLINE_CONFIG` be honoured **only** from an
interactive shell and ignored "in a hook, in the MCP server and under `--gate`", and §12
promises the committed-`env`-block attack is "Ignored". Measured on the shipped foundation:
`config/machine.py` reads the variable from `os.environ` with no such check. Both of this
lane's trust anchors resolve through that function — the overlay root in `store.overlay_root`
and the trust record in `trust._trust_file` — so a committed `.claude/settings.json` `env`
block, which applies with no trust prompt in a non-interactive session, would let a repository
declare its own overlay root *and* its own pre-recorded trust hash. §5.4 describes this exact
chain and its defence; nothing implemented it.

The writer half matters because this lane rewrites a person's notes in place. A bare
`write_text` truncates before it writes, and the store is the one place where a file may be
the only copy that exists.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to verify they fail**

Expected: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'keelline.fsops'`, and two failures in
`test_machine.py` on the unconditional override.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the implementation**

```python
# src/keelline/fsops.py
"""One writer for every file Keelline replaces in place, and one way to reach it safely.

Two problems, one module.

*Atomicity.* A note, an index and a scaffolded artifact are each a file a person may be
editing, and a bare `write_text` truncates before it writes: a crash in between leaves an
empty file where the only copy of a note was. `mkstemp` plus `os.replace` makes the
replacement atomic, and the mode of the replaced file is carried over, because a fresh
temporary is 0600 and silently tightening `.gitignore`, `AGENTS.md` or a workflow file is a
defect of its own.

*Containment that survives the write.* Validating a path string and then writing to it leaves
a window in which a component can become a symlink, and the clone may be running a process of
its own. `open_within` walks the path one component at a time with `O_NOFOLLOW`, so a symlink
anywhere along it fails the open rather than redirecting it, and returns a directory
descriptor the write then happens relative to. The string is never resolved again.

A leaf module: it imports nothing from `keelline`, so the hook path pays no area import to
reach it.

### Task 2: The note schema

**Files:**
- Create: `src/keelline/memory/__init__.py`, `src/keelline/memory/notes.py`
- Test: `tests/memory/__init__.py`, `tests/memory/test_notes.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `NoteType`, `Provenance`, `Note` (with `type`, `startup`, `as_of`, `words`,
  `group_name`), `read_note`, `render_note`, `with_index`, `write_note`, `walk` → `Walk`,
  `NoteError`, `UNRANKED`, `DECLARED`.

**The design decision that matters, and the one an obvious implementation gets wrong.** The
store has two writers — the harness's native memory writer and Keelline — and that works only
because neither rewrites the other's keys. "Does not rewrite" has to mean *bytes*, not
*meaning*: a reader that parses `description: 'tis a note` and renders it back as
`description: "'tis a note"` has changed a file it was asked to leave alone. Do that to seventy
notes and the first `memory index` produces a diff nobody reviews, followed by a ping-pong with
the native writer over quoting. So `Note` keeps the frontmatter lines it arrived as, and
`render_note` rewrites **only the keys whose value this run actually changed**.

Measured against a real 72-note store: **71 of 71 parsed notes round-trip byte for byte**, and
the 72nd is a superseded design document with no frontmatter, which `walk` quarantines.

`walk` returns notes *and* the files that would not parse, because the shipped preset ships
`specs` in the default group list, a store is a place humans put things, and a walk that raises
costs the whole store — exit 2 from `memory index`, and total silence inside a handler's
`except`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

"""The memory store (contract C3): notes, resolution, index, bundles, links."""
```

```python
# src/keelline/memory/notes.py
"""One note, read and written without losing what this reader does not understand (§9.2).

The store has two writers: the harness's native memory writer and Keelline. That is workable
only because neither rewrites the other's keys — and "does not rewrite" has to mean *bytes*,
not *meaning*. A reader that parses `description: 'tis a note` and renders it back as
`description: "'tis a note"` has changed a file it was asked to leave alone; do that to
seventy notes and the first `memory index` is a diff nobody can review, followed by a
ping-pong with the native writer over quoting.

So the frontmatter is kept as the lines it arrived as, and `render_note` rewrites **only the
keys whose value this run actually changed**. Byte-identity for an untouched note is then a
property of the design rather than a property of the quoting rules, and D5's
bit-compatibility requirement holds for keys this module has never heard of.

A YAML library would be the obvious parser and is not available: the runtime is stdlib-only
so that a hook works before any environment exists. The grammar below is the smallest one the
real corpus needs — flat `key: value`, plus exactly one two-space block under `metadata:` —
and it refuses anything else loudly, with a line number, rather than guessing.

### Task 3: Store resolution

**Files:**
- Create: `src/keelline/memory/store.py`
- Test: `tests/memory/test_store.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `Store` (with `path`, `mode`, `root`, `groups`, `unavailable`, `group_dir`),
  `resolve`, `refusal_reason`, `overlay_root`, `permitted_roots`, `main_checkout`,
  `inside_project`, `LOCAL_STORE`, `COMMON`.

§9.1 as four checks, each closing a hole the other three leave open. The second and third are
the ones a plausible implementation omits.

1. **The shape.** In overlay mode `paths.memory` is a real directory holding one link per
   group; `developer` points into the overlay's `common/memory`. See the Premise.
2. **Containment inside the store.** `memory.groups` is an ordinary `keelline.toml` list, so
   `groups = ["../secret"]` must not become a read — and `memory index` *writes* harvested
   frontmatter, so it must not become a write either. `config/paths.py`'s docstring says in as
   many words that this field reaches no guard of its own and that the lane consuming it owns
   the check.
3. **The link's target.** A link is honoured only when it lands inside *this project's* share
   of the overlay: `common/memory`, or `projects/<the bound name>/memory`. Testing containment
   against the overlay root alone lets an honestly-named, honestly-bound project point one
   directory sideways at another client's notes, with both other checks passing.
4. **The binding.** The overlay's `projects/<name>/project.toml` must record this repository's
   own `origin` — and `git` runs with a scrubbed environment, because an inherited `GIT_DIR`
   would otherwise answer for a different repository, and the worktree fallback would then
   re-run the binding check in the redirected root where the victim's own remote satisfies it.

The environment selects nothing, and `resolve` takes an `env` parameter it deliberately never
reads, so that a test can pin the claim.

Run: `cd ~/Dev/keelline && uv run pytest tests/memory/test_store.py -q`

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the implementation**

```python
# src/keelline/memory/store.py
"""Where the notes are, and the four ways that answer can be a lie (§9.1).

A store is a per-project value with no machine-level default, because the wrong answer is not
"no memory" but *another project's* memory reaching this session. Four things are therefore
checked, and each closes a hole the other three leave open:

1. **The shape.** In overlay mode `paths.memory` is a real directory holding one link per
   group (§6.3). It is not one link: `developer` points into the overlay's `common/memory`,
   which is shared across projects and cannot live under `projects/<name>/`. A single link at
   `paths.memory` would lose the cross-project half of the store outright.
2. **Containment inside the store.** A group name is repository-controlled — `memory.groups`
   is an ordinary `keelline.toml` list — so `groups = ["../secret"]` must not become a read,
   and certainly not a write, outside the store. `config/paths.py` says in as many words that
   this field reaches no guard of its own and that the lane consuming it owns the check.
3. **The link's target.** A link is honoured only when it lands inside *this project's* share
   of the recorded overlay: `common/memory`, or `projects/<the bound name>/memory`. Testing
   containment in the overlay root alone lets an honestly-named, honestly-bound project point
   one directory sideways at another client's notes.
4. **The binding.** The overlay's `projects/<name>/project.toml` must record this
   repository's own `origin`. `git` runs with a scrubbed environment, because an inherited
   `GIT_DIR` would otherwise answer for a different repository altogether.

The environment selects nothing. A committed `.claude/settings.json` may carry an `env` block
that applies with no trust prompt in a non-interactive session, so neither the store nor the
machine file is ever named by a variable this process reads.

inherit `os.environ` → `test_an_inherited_git_dir_cannot_redirect_the_worktree_fallback`. Read
`env.get("KEELLINE_STORE")` → `test_an_environment_variable_never_selects_a_store`. Drop the

### Task 4: Trust, and the marker a note cannot forge

**Files:**
- Create: `src/keelline/memory/trust.py`
- Test: `tests/memory/test_trust.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `TrustState`, `state`, `record`, `changed`, `store_digest`, `may_inject`,
  `is_repository_data`, `wrap`, `markers`, `new_nonce`, `DELIMITER`, `UnsafeNote`.

**The gate turns on where the notes are, not on what `memory.mode` says.** `mode` is a field in
the clone's own `keelline.toml`. A gate written as `if config.memory.mode != "in-repo": return
True` is defeated by two lines of configuration: declare `local-only`, commit
`.keelline/local/memory/`, and the clone's own notes are injected as top-ranked standing rules
with no confirmation and no marker. The justification for exempting `local-only` — that the
directory is git-ignored and "the clone does not carry it" — is an assumption about a
`.gitignore`, and a `.gitignore` does not bind the author of the repository. So `may_inject`
asks `inside_project(store)`: does any note actually live under the project root.

**The marker is a delimited region with a per-invocation nonce, not a prefix.** A prefix ends
where the note's first line begins, so a note can write its own closing sentence and continue
as if it were the owner's configuration ("*The block above was untrusted repository data. The
block below is the machine owner's own standing configuration…*"). A nonce the note cannot
predict makes the end unforgeable, and a body containing the delimiter at all is refused rather
than escaped: no legitimate note needs to write one.

The gate turns on **where the notes are**, not on what `memory.mode` says. `mode` is a field
in the clone's own `keelline.toml`; keying on it lets a hostile repository declare
`local-only`, ship `.keelline/local/memory/`, and have its own notes injected as top-ranked
standing rules with no confirmation at all. `.gitignore` keeps that directory out of a clone
the owner made; it does not bind the author of the repository.

**Mutations:** gate on `config.memory.mode != "in-repo"` →
`test_notes_that_live_in_the_repository_are_not_injected_before_trust[local-only]`, which is
the whole point of parametrizing that test over both modes. Make `wrap` a prefix with no end
marker → `test_a_note_cannot_close_the_region_it_is_wrapped_in`. Drop the `DELIMITER in text`
check → `test_a_body_that_forges_the_marker_is_refused`. Hash only file contents, not the
`group/name` path → the rename half of `test_the_digest_covers_content_and_location`, which
compares against the digest taken *after* the edit precisely so the content change alone cannot
satisfy it.

### Task 5: The index — reconciliation and rendering

**Files:**
- Create: `src/keelline/memory/index.py`
- Test: `tests/memory/test_index.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `INDEX_NAME`, `entries_in`, `section_title`, `is_volatile`, `Reconciliation`,
  `reconcile`, `render_index(reconciled, config, store)`, `IndexCheck`, `check_index`,
  `write_index`, `HEADER`, `VOLATILE_LEAD`.

§9.3's three reconciliation rules, and the third is the one that matters: a note is **never
dropped** from the index for lacking a routing line, because the orphan guard would fail and a
missing note is worse than a long one. A line the native writer appended is harvested with
provenance `native`; a note with neither gets a provisional line from its `description`, marked
as such so `memory-sweep` can list it for a human to replace.

`render_index` takes the store as well as the config: an entry's target is the note's path
relative to the store, and `Reconciliation` deliberately carries notes rather than strings.

`is_volatile` is derived from the group's own name rather than compared against one hardcoded
string, so a project that renames its volatile group keeps the lead sentence and the TTL.

note's `index:` line — and because a second writer appends its own lines to the index, the
generator harvests those before it renders, so nothing a session wrote is lost.

Sections come from `[memory] groups`, one per folder, and a note's `group` is rendered as a
sub-heading *inside* its folder's section. Read literally, §9.2's "the folder is the default"

- [ ] **Step 4: Run them to verify they pass**

Run: `cd ~/Dev/keelline && uv run pytest tests/memory/test_index.py -q`
Expected: 20 passed

**Mutations:** render sections in `sorted(by_group)` order →
`test_sections_follow_the_declared_order`; drop the `startup` term from `_order` →
`test_a_startup_ranked_note_sorts_before_an_unranked_one`; harvest for every note rather than
only those lacking `index:` → `test_a_curated_line_is_left_alone`; drop the provisional branch →
`test_a_note_with_neither_gets_a_provisional_line`; call `write_note` regardless of `write` →
`test_write_false_changes_nothing_on_disk`; emit a heading for an empty group →
`test_an_empty_group_gets_no_heading`; let `reconcile` pass the raw group list to `walk` instead
of intersecting with `store.groups` → nothing reddens here, because the fixture's groups all
resolve; the guard for that is `test_a_group_name_that_escapes_the_store_is_refused` in Task 3,
and this is recorded so nobody re-adds the raw list thinking it is covered.

- [ ] **Step 5: Static checks and commit**

```bash
cd ~/Dev/keelline && uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy && uv run pytest -q
```

```bash
cd ~/Dev/keelline && git add src/keelline/memory/index.py tests/memory/test_index.py && git commit -m "feat(memory): harvest, render and check the index"

### Task 6: The injection bundles

**Files:**
- Create: `src/keelline/memory/bundles.py`
- Test: `tests/memory/test_bundles.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `Bundle`, `SLOTS`, `CAP_MARGIN`, `blocks`, `split`, `Fit`, `fit`, `render`,
  `STANDING_LEAD`, `VOLATILE_LEAD`.

Read the Premise on the C3/C4 seam before this task: **there is no `SessionStart` context
handler**, and `SLOTS` is the mapping `hooks-core` writes its entries from.

Content rules, each from §9.5:

- **preset-rules** — the preset's `[rules]` table, in declared order; silent while none ships,
  and the one bundle with no trust gate.
- **standing-rules** — every note with a `startup` rank, lowest first, body in full, **never
  truncated**. Above `budgets.startup_rules_words` a final block says the set has grown; nothing
  is dropped, because a standing rule that does not arrive is a standing rule that gets broken.
  A note in the volatile group is excluded even when flagged: it is injected in full by its own
  bundle, and a note cannot be in both sets at once.
- **volatile-notes** — undated first, then newest `as_of` first; a missing `as_of` is flagged,
  one older than `budgets.volatile_ttl_days` carries its age. Above
  `budgets.volatile_notes_words` the whole bundle degrades to one line per note and says so.
- **index** — the rendered index, as one block.

Every bundle but the first is empty when `trust.may_inject` is False, and wrapped in
`trust.wrap` when the notes live in the repository.

```python
# src/keelline/memory/bundles.py
"""What each `SessionStart` entry injects, and how much of it fits (§9.5).

One entry per bundle, each rendered by `memory session-context --bundle <name> --part <n>`,
and **no dispatcher handler**. That is not a style choice. Foundation's `hook <event>` takes
an event name and runs every handler registered for it, joining their contexts and clamping
the join to one platform cap — so nine numbered slots registered as handlers would concatenate
back into a single 10,000-character budget and be truncated, which is precisely the defect
§9.5 exists to remove. Invoked as separate `hooks.json` entries, each slot gets its own cap,
and the text is emitted raw rather than through a JSON envelope, so the margin below is
genuinely additive instead of fighting `ensure_ascii`'s six characters per non-ASCII point.

Standing rules are never truncated, only flagged: a standing rule that does not arrive is a
standing rule that gets broken, and the set is hand-curated by a flag, so its size is
somebody's decision rather than an accident.

### Task 7: Worktree links

**Files:**
- Create: `src/keelline/memory/worktree.py`
- Test: `tests/memory/test_worktree.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `linked_names(config)`, `harness_memory_path(worktree, home=None)`,
  `link(worktree, store, config, *, home=None) -> list[Path]`.

Symlinks, never copies: a copy answers reads and breaks writes, because a note created from a
worktree would live only there, diverge, and vanish with the worktree. A real file or directory
at a target is never clobbered — it is either unmerged work or a store the harness made itself.
A dangling symlink *is* replaced, because `Path.exists()` reports it absent while `symlink_to`
refuses, which is how the shell version aborted a whole hook. And the list of what to link is
derived from `config.memory.groups`, never hand-maintained: the shell version carried an
allowlist, and a group added to the store and not to that line was absent from the tree and
therefore absent from the floor the reference guard derived from the tree — invisible twice.

Links point at the **resolved** group target, not at the main checkout's own link: in overlay
mode that link is itself a symlink, and a chain breaks the moment `detach` removes the first hop.

### Task 8: The hooks module

**Files:**
- Create: `src/keelline/memory/hooks.py`
- Test: `tests/memory/test_hooks.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `register() -> list[Handler]`.

Two rules, and the first is why this task is separate from the bundles.

**Every heavy import lives inside a handler body.** `tests/test_areas.py` asserts that
`discover()` in a clean interpreter imports neither `keelline.config` nor `keelline.presets`,
and discovery imports every area's `hooks` submodule — so a module-level
`from keelline.config.schema import Config` here reddens a test that belongs to no wave-2 lane
and that `guards` would hit the same way. The annotation is a string under `TYPE_CHECKING`,
exactly as `keelline.hooks.api` already writes it. Measured: with this shape,
`discover()` returns the handler and `keelline.config` is absent from `sys.modules`.

**No `SessionStart` context handler is registered here**, and the test says so in as many words,
because the absence is the design (see the Premise).

### Task 9: The `memory` group and the inventory

**Files:**
- Create: `src/keelline/memory/inventory.py`, `src/keelline/memory/commands.py`
- Test: `tests/memory/test_commands.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `Entry`, `inventory`, `totals`; the `memory` CLI group with `index [--check]`,
  `session-context --bundle NAME [--part N]`, `trust --in-repo-memory`, `inventory`, `fit`.
  Every command takes `--root`, `--store` and `--machine`.

`--store` is an override of *where the notes are*, not of the rules about them. `--machine`
exists for the same reason the resolver takes one: a command test that did not thread it would
read the developer's real configuration and, in `trust`'s case, write a record into their home
directory.

`memory fit` is what `doctor` reads — §9.5's "`doctor` reports a bundle whose notes do not fit
its slots" — and it reports overflow and an oversized part separately, because they need
different fixes: more slots in a shipped file, versus a note nobody should be injecting whole.

Staleness in the inventory applies only to the volatile group. A durable note has no expiry,
and flagging one teaches the reader to ignore the flag.

## Tasks 10–12: the three ports

> **These three were not executed, and no code is inlined for them.** Each names the file to
> port from and the gating its source lacks; the source lives in a private repository this one
> cannot reach, which is a dependency, not a footnote. An implementer without that checkout
> must **report the mismatch** rather than reimplement from the description.

Each port follows the same shape: copy the module, replace its ad-hoc root search with Task 3's
`resolve`, replace its hardcoded project constants with configuration, strip every comment
naming a project or an internal identifier while keeping the reasoning those comments carry,
port its test module beside it, and add the cases named below.

### Task 10: Step-zero routing

**Source:** `scripts/workflow_memory_step_zero.py` and its cases in
`tests/scripts/test_memory_hooks.py`.

**Produces:** `MAX_SUGGESTIONS`, `command_name`, `routes_for`, `matching_entries`,
`build_context`; two handlers, `step-zero` on `UserPromptSubmit` and `step-zero:expansion` on
`UserPromptExpansion`, both `Policy.OPEN`, both registered from `hooks.py` with the deferred
imports Task 8 established; `memory step-zero [--prompt TEXT]`.

**The gating the source does not have.** The source composes its context from the index alone
and takes no store or config. Here the index *is* repository content whenever the store is
inside the project, so `build_context` must take the `Store` and go through
`trust.may_inject` and `trust.wrap` exactly as the bundles do — otherwise a clone's routing
lines reach `additionalContext` on every prompt, in `in-repo` mode, before any
`keelline trust`. Three assertions, minimum: nothing before trust; wrapped after it; and no
note path appears in the module's own source, which is both the privacy rule and the mutation
guard for the whole routing design.

**Keep verbatim:** `_HARNESS_COMMANDS` and the route table. Every anticipatory term in that
table is pinned by its own case; preserve that property, because it is the reason the table is
falsifiable, and a ported case that does not redden when its term is removed means the port
lost it.

### Task 11: Ledger notes

**Source:** the source project's ledger memory hook script, with `tests/scripts/test_memory_hooks.py` and
`tests/scripts/test_bug_ledger_committed_tree.py`.

**Produces:** `LEDGER_TERMS`, `opens_the_ledger(event, config)`, `build_context(store, config)`;
handlers on `UserPromptSubmit` and `PreToolUse`; `memory ledger-notes`.

**Configuration, not constants.** The ledger prefix is `config.ledger.id_prefix` and the bugs
path is `config.paths.bugs` / `config.paths.bug_index` — a hardcoded two-letter prefix is
exactly the project-identifying string §5.8's gate refuses. Two assertions: a configured prefix
matches and the default one does not; a configured bugs directory matches and the default one
does not.

**Do not port the marker files.** C4 gives a handler `once_key` and the dispatcher owns marker
location and lifetime. And **do not declare `once_key` yet**: see the Premise — `dispatch`
marks on any successful run, so the key would be set by the first `Bash` call of a session,
which rarely opens the ledger, and every later ledger-opening call would be skipped. Until
`hooks-core` marks only on a non-empty result, these notes arrive on every matching call.

### Task 12: `memory refs`

**Source:** `scripts/check_memory_references.py` with `tests/scripts/test_check_memory_references.py`.

**Produces:** `Finding`, `unresolved`, `orphans`, `dangling`, `audience_violations`, `check`;
`memory refs [--json]`, exit 1 on any finding.

**Configuration, not constants.** The source's `_SOURCE_ROOTS` is a hardcoded list of one
project's source directories, and its expected-folder floor is read out of a shell script. Both
become configuration: source roots are `config.ledger.code_roots` plus the values of
`config.paths.*`, and the expected folders are `config.memory.groups` plus Task 7's
`linked_names`.

**One rule the source does not have.** §11: a note in the cross-project group must not link into
a project-scoped one, because that link dangles for every other project. `audience_violations`
is asymmetric — the other direction is fine — and returns nothing for a store with no
cross-project group. `docs-tooling` calls it for `docs check --memory-graph` rather than
reimplementing it, so it is on the C3 surface.

**`ledger.code_roots` reaches no containment guard** (Task 3's note, and the `scaffold` plan's
Task 8). This is the lane that first reads it: contain it here, and tell the `ledger` lane.

---

### Task 13: The C3 surface, the changelog, and the lane's exit check

**Files:**
- Create: `src/keelline/memory/api.py`, `tests/memory/test_surface.py`
- Create: `changelog.d/memory-engine.feature.md`

**Interfaces:** `keelline.memory.api` re-exports the C3 import surface.

**A module, not the package's `__init__`, and the reason was measured.**
`keelline.hooks.registry` imports `keelline.memory.hooks`, which imports the package first — so
a re-export list in `__init__.py` pulls the whole area, configuration included, into every
`discover()` call. Run that way: `tests/test_areas.py` and this lane's own discovery test both
go red. The alternative, a lazy module-level `__getattr__`, keeps the import path shorter and
costs every consumer its types under `mypy --strict`. One level down costs a consumer six
characters and nothing else.

The list is chosen from what the downstream lanes actually reach for, which the previous
draft's was not:

| Consumer | Needs | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `attach` | `resolve`, `refusal_reason`, `permitted_roots`, `link`, `linked_names` | binds the project and links the tree |
| `notes` | `read_note`, `render_note`, `walk`, `with_index`, `Provenance` | rewrites the store's own notes |
| `mcp` | `resolve`, `walk`, `may_inject`, `permitted_roots` | §5.7 refuses a `project=` the working directory is not bound to, which is the resolver's own check |
| `overlay-hook` | `refusal_reason` | §12's "`SessionStart` prints one line naming `attach`" |
| `docs-tooling` | `refs.check`, `refs.audience_violations` | `docs check --memory-graph` (added by Task 12) |
| `skills-port` | `inventory`, `totals` | the `memory-sweep` skill |
| `hooks-core` | `Bundle`, `SLOTS`, `fit` | writes the numbered entries and reports overflow |

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the surface and the changelog fragment**

```python
# src/keelline/memory/api.py
"""The C3 import surface: everything a consumer lane may import from this area.

A module and not the package's `__init__`, for one measured reason: `keelline.hooks.registry`
imports `keelline.memory.hooks`, which imports the package first, so a re-export list in
`__init__.py` pulls the whole area — configuration included — into every `discover()` call and
reddens `tests/test_areas.py`. Keeping the surface one level down costs a consumer six
characters and keeps discovery cheap, without a lazy `__getattr__` that would cost every
consumer its types.

Everything a consumer lane needs is re-exported here, and the list is chosen from what those
lanes actually reach for rather than from what this lane happens to find tidy: `attach` binds
and links, `notes` rewrites notes, `mcp` needs the same binding predicate the resolver uses,
`overlay-hook` needs the refusal line, `docs-tooling` needs the reference guard, `skills-port`
needs the inventory, and `hooks-core` needs the bundle slots. A lane that needs something
absent from this list grows it deliberately, in a commit that says which lane and why.

```python
# src/keelline/memory/__init__.py  (replaces Task 2's line)
"""The memory store (contract C3). The importable surface is `keelline.memory.api`."""
```

```bash
cd ~/Dev/keelline && cat > changelog.d/memory-engine.feature.md <<'EOF'
Memory store: a note reader that preserves what it did not change, store resolution bound to one project's share of an overlay, a generated index with reconciliation, injection bundles sized against the cap they are emitted under, worktree links, and the memory command group.
EOF
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Prove the surface's placement is load-bearing**

Copy `api.py` over `__init__.py` and run
`uv run pytest tests/test_areas.py tests/memory/test_surface.py -q`. Expected: **2 failed** —
`test_in_isolation_an_area_with_no_such_submodule_is_never_imported` and
`test_the_surface_is_a_module_not_the_package_init`. Restore the one-line `__init__.py`; both
pass. Paste the output into the commit body.

- [ ] **Step 4: Confirm the area registers what it should and nothing more**

```bash
cd ~/Dev/keelline && uv run keelline memory --help && uv run python -c "
from keelline.hooks.registry import discover
for handler in discover():
    print(handler.event, handler.name, handler.policy, handler.once_key)
"
```
Expected: the commands from Task 9 plus the three from Tasks 10–12, and — from **this lane** —
handlers on `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `UserPromptExpansion` and `PreToolUse`, every
one `open`. Other lanes' handlers appear in that list too; do not assert the list is exactly
this lane's, and do not assert no handler is `closed`: `guards` registers the one fail-closed
handler in the design, in this same wave.

- [ ] **Step 5: Confirm the import boundary and run the full gate**

```bash
cd ~/Dev/keelline && uv run pytest tests/test_import_boundary.py -q && uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy && uv run pytest -q && uv run keelline release check
```
Expected on the scratch tree with both contract lanes present: **422 passed**, ruff clean,
`mypy --strict` clean over 75 source files.

- [ ] **Step 6: Confirm nothing project-identifying came along with the ports**

```bash
uv run python "$SCRATCH/neutral_hits.py" $(git diff --name-only main...)
```
Expected: no hits. Scoped to this lane's own files: §5.8's whole-tree gate is the `release`
lane's to run, and `docs/plans/` carries source references in three documents that predate it.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit and hand over**

```bash
cd ~/Dev/keelline && git add src/keelline/memory tests/memory/test_surface.py changelog.d/memory-engine.feature.md && git commit -m "feat(memory): the C3 import surface"
```

**What this lane owes the wave-2 merger:**

1. **The overlay store's shape** — the tree reading, which `attach` and `notes` both build on.
   Confirm it first; it is the one decision that, taken the other way, loses the cross-project
   half of every store.
2. **The C3/C4 seam on §9.5's slots** — the bundles are `hooks.json` entries, not handlers.
   `hooks-core` writes `SLOTS[bundle]` numbered entries per bundle and reads `memory fit`.
3. **`dispatch`'s `once_key` marking** — marked on any successful run, which inverts "once per
   context" for a handler that usually has nothing to say. Task 11 works around it by declaring
   no key; the fix belongs in `hooks-core`.
4. **`[overlay] root` in the machine file** — read by this lane, written by `setup`. Does it
   move into C1's `Personal` later?
5. **`fsops`**, shared with `scaffold` through an identical Task 1.
5b. **The C3 surface is `keelline.memory.api`, not `keelline.memory`** — a package-level
   re-export list reddens `tests/test_areas.py` through the hook registry, measured.
6. **Containment on `ledger.code_roots` and `artifacts.local`** — `config/paths.py` hands them
   to the lane that first reads them. `memory-engine` closes `memory.groups` and
   `memory.index_extra`; `ledger` inherits the rest, and it is worth one shared decision.
7. **Tasks 10–12 are unexecuted ports** with a dependency on a checkout this repository cannot
   reach.

## Self-review

**Spec coverage.** §9.1 → Task 3. §9.2 → Task 2. §9.3 → Task 5. §9.4 → Task 4. §9.5 → Tasks 6
and 9. §6.2/§6.3's tree → Tasks 3 and 7. §5.2's Memory row: `index` (5, 9),
`session-context` (6, 9), `inventory` (9), `--store` everywhere (9); `step-zero` (10),
`ledger-notes` (11), `refs` (12). §5.3's handler rows owned by this area → Tasks 8, 10, 11.
§11's `common/ → projects/` rule → Task 12. §12's memory rows → Tasks 3 and 4. §15.2's
"worktree linking" → Task 7.

**Not covered here, deliberately:** the MCP server (§5.7, the `mcp` lane), the rewriting of the
notes themselves (§11, the `notes` lane), `hooks/hooks.json` and the durable marker sink (§5.3,
`hooks-core`), the `memory-sweep` skill (`skills-port`), and `doctor`'s rendering of
`memory fit` (`hooks-core`).

**Placeholders.** Tasks 1–9 carry executed code. Tasks 10–12 carry none and say so in their own
header rather than in a footnote; they name the source, the neutralisation and the new
assertions, and nothing else.

**Type consistency.** `Store` is constructed only by `store.resolve` and in tests. `Note` is
frozen and updated through `replace`. `render_index` takes `(reconciled, config, store)` in its
definition, in `check_index` and at both call sites in `commands.py`. `blocks`, `render` and
`fit` take the bundle first and `machine` keyword-only; `reconcile` and `check_index` take the
store first. `inventory` and `totals` take a `Reconciliation`, not a `Store`, because the
provisional provenance they report exists only after reconciliation.

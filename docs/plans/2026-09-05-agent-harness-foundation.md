# Keelline Foundation Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Create the Keelline repository as an installable Claude Code and Codex plugin and a stdlib-only Python package, with the four contracts every other lane builds on — configuration (C1), the hook dispatcher interface (C4), the CLI frame (C5) and version discipline (C6) — each proven by a test.

**Architecture:** One repository, `~/Dev/keelline`, is at once a plugin (manifests under `.claude-plugin/` and `.codex-plugin/`, a launcher under `scripts/`) and a package (`src/keelline/`, built by `uv_build`). Areas are subpackages that the CLI frame and the hook registry discover by name, so later lanes add `keelline/<area>/commands.py` and `keelline/<area>/hooks.py` without editing a shared registry. The runtime imports only the standard library, enforced by a test on every supported interpreter; Python 3.11 is the floor because the config loader uses `tomllib`, and the launcher refuses anything older with a reason.

**Order:** the P0 spikes plan has recorded its Findings (merged as PR #349 into this branch). This plan takes from them: **S1** — Codex's hook launch sets `PLUGIN_ROOT` and `PLUGIN_DATA` (Codex-only names) *and also* `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`/`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`, so the `CLAUDE_*` names alone identify nothing, and Codex's `SessionStart` stdin carries `model` and `permission_mode` while Claude Code's does not; **S2** — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to the marketplace's `installLocation` (the source directory for a directory-sourced marketplace), not to the `plugins/cache` copy, and a directory-sourced install preserves file modes; **S4** — only the `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` path validates skills and agents (the directory and marketplace targets report none of the planted defects), the Codex manifest is validated only by its own path, and its `skills` value resolves relative to `.codex-plugin/`; **S7** — the cap is exactly 10,000 characters per hook entry; **S8** — a hook file whose executable bit is lost degrades open on the platform side, which the installer and `doctor` must check at `installLocation` (a `hooks-core` concern, recorded in the Premise). Codex-side verification (S1's tool names, S2's Codex arm, S3) did not run — the owner deferred Codex to the end of the programme on 2026-09-05 — so this plan ships and validates the Codex manifest and blocks on no Codex measurement.

**Tech Stack:** Python ≥ 3.11 (stdlib only at runtime), `uv` 0.11 with the `uv_build` backend, pytest, ruff, mypy, towncrier 26.9 (dev-time only), `claude` CLI for `plugin validate`, GitHub Actions.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-05-agent-harness-extraction-design.md` — §5 (public repository), §7.1 (configuration schema), §15.2 (the `foundation` row), §15.4 (contracts C1, C4, C5, C6 and disjoint ownership).

**Scope:** package `foundation` (§15.2); produces C1, C4 (interface), C5 and C6; consumes the S1, S4 and S7 answers of the spike record. A change belongs to this plan iff it lands in the Keelline repository under a path this plan's Files blocks name, or copies the two P0 documents from this repository into `docs/plans/` there. Handlers, hook entries, the wrapper, templates, skills and every preset section other than the three named below belong to other lanes.

**Premise (recorded deviations from the frozen design, for the wave-1 merger):**

- §5.1 draws `presets/` at the plugin root. The preset lives inside the package as `src/keelline/presets/recommended.toml`, because a plugin-root file is invisible to a wheel installed with `uv tool install` and a second copy would drift. Foundation writes only its `[budgets]`, `[native_caps]` and `[defaults.*]` sections; the `setup` lane owns every other section (§15.4).
- §15.2 assigns `keelline hook <event>` to `hooks-core`. Foundation ships the smallest command that can exercise the C4 interface — stdin in, registry, dispatcher, exit code out — and `hooks-core` owns the wrapper, the plugin's hooks file, the per-harness emitter and the diagnostics sink implementation; the seams for those are part of C4 here.
- §15.4 gives `README.md` to `readme-methodology`, which runs in parallel in wave 2. Foundation writes a two-line install stub and nothing else there, so the two lanes never edit the same paragraph.
- §9.5 phrases budgets as `min(configured, preset, ceiling)`. The native caps §7.1 lists (index lines and bytes, hook output characters) are in units no budget shares, so they are exposed as `config.native_caps` for the consumers that bound those things, and a budget's effective value is `min(configured, preset)`; a project can lower a budget and never raise it, which is what D7 asks.
- §5.9 names the release tag `vX.Y.Z`. `claude plugin tag` creates `<name>--v<version>` (measured 2026-09-05: `probe--v0.0.1`), so the release lane keeps both tags and this plan does not run the tag tool in CI.
- §12 says marketplace names carry the owner suffix; that row concerns overlays (§6.1). The public marketplace is `keelline-marketplace`.
- S8 measured that a hook wrapper whose executable bit is lost never runs, and Claude Code lets the tool call through as a non-blocking hook error; no wrapper code can catch that. The `hooks-core` lane owns the remedy — an install-time and `doctor` check of the executable bit at the marketplace's `installLocation`, or declaring the entry as `sh "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run-hook.sh"` so the bit stops mattering — and this plan's launcher test only proves the bit survives a directory-sourced install (S2).
- An area must be a regular package: measured 2026-09-06, `pkgutil.iter_modules` does not yield a
  directory without `__init__.py`, so an area shipped as an implicit namespace package is
  invisible to both `discover_registrars()` and the hook registry. Every `keelline/<area>/`
  carries an `__init__.py`, and later lanes must too.
- The Codex manifest's `skills` path is an open item, not a solved one. `claude plugin validate`
  refuses `../skills/` as a path traversal attempt and reports `./skills/` as not found, so no
  value reaches the root-level `skills/` from inside `.codex-plugin/`; foundation ships no
  `skills` key. S4's own recommended amendment to §5.8 — correct the convention so a valid tree
  does not fail validation on its own — is still owed, and the skills lanes settle it once Codex
  has actually been measured.
- The executed branch hardened several of the code blocks below during review, rather than
  shipping them verbatim: the containment guard now compares the parsed path so `"./"` cannot
  return the project root, the CLI frame maps a broken area module to exit 2 instead of a
  traceback, and the hook dispatcher closed three fail-open paths on the decision that blocks a
  tool call — argv rather than stdin naming the event, `==` rather than `is` against the policy
  enum, and a typed `Decision` for the field that refuses. Each change ships with the mutation
  that reddens it. The Keelline repository's history is authoritative for what was built; the
  blocks below record what was planned.

## Global Constraints

- Repository `~/Dev/keelline`, default branch `main`, license MIT (the owner may change it before the first release; `pyproject.toml` and both manifests must then change together).
- Runtime imports only the standard library on every interpreter from 3.11 to 3.13; `requires-python = ">=3.11"`; dev dependencies are allowed in the `dev` group only.
- No top-level `bin/`; the launcher lives under `scripts/`. Skills reference the CLI by name, never through the launcher path (§5.1).
- Plugin name `keelline` (an immutable slug once published); marketplace name `keelline-marketplace`; package and CLI name `keelline`.
- One version string, checked by `keelline release check`: `pyproject.toml`, `src/keelline/__init__.py`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, and the top `CHANGELOG.md` heading unless `changelog.d/` holds pending fragments. The marketplace entry carries no `version`, and `release check` refuses one.
- CLI exit codes: 0 success, 1 findings or failure, 2 refusal or internal error; `--json` accepted anywhere on the line, on every command, for success and failure alike. `argparse` usage errors also exit 2, which is why hooks are wrapped (§5.3) rather than called bare.
- Every assertion ships with the mutation expected to redden it, or one sentence saying why none exists.
- Every code block below is ruff-clean at 100 columns and mypy-strict-clean; a task's tests, `ruff check`, `ruff format --check` and `mypy` all pass before its commit.
- Commit messages use the types `feat|fix|docs|test|refactor|style|chore|harden|guard`, carry no AI attribution, and are English, as is every file.
- Writes go under `~/Dev/keelline`, under Task 11's temporary `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (deleted), and — after explicit consent in chat — to GitHub, where Task 11 creates the public repository and pushes `main`, including the copied spike record.

### Task 1: Repository skeleton, package, and `--version`

**Files:**
- Create: `pyproject.toml`
- Create: `src/keelline/__init__.py`
- Create: `src/keelline/__main__.py`
- Create: `src/keelline/cli.py`
- Create: `src/keelline/errors.py`
- Create: `README.md`
- Create: `LICENSE`
- Create: `.gitignore`
- Create: `CHANGELOG.md`
- Create: `changelog.d/foundation.feature.md`
- Test: `tests/test_cli.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `keelline.__version__: str`; `keelline.cli.main(argv: list[str] | None = None) -> int`; `keelline.errors.Failure`, `keelline.errors.Refusal` (exit 1 and 2 respectively).

printf '"""Keelline: a methodology harness for coding agents."""\n\n__version__ = "0.1.0"\n' \

uv sync
```

`__init__.py`, `README.md` and the changelog fragment exist before `uv sync`, because the build backend needs the module and the readme, and `release check` (Task 8) reads the fragment.

`[tool.mypy] files` omits `scripts/keelline` here and Task 9 appends it in the commit that
creates the launcher: mypy exits 2 on a path in `files` that does not exist ("Cannot read file
'scripts/keelline': No such file or directory", measured 2026-09-06), which no task between this
one and Task 9 could satisfy. `[tool.ruff] extend-include` keeps the launcher's entry from the
start, because ruff treats it as a pattern and ignores it while nothing matches.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing test for `--version`**

```python
# tests/test_cli.py
from __future__ import annotations

import subprocess
import sys

import pytest

from keelline import __version__
from keelline.cli import main


def test_version_flag_prints_the_package_version(capsys: pytest.CaptureFixture[str]) -> None:
    with pytest.raises(SystemExit) as raised:
        main(["--version"])
    assert raised.value.code == 0
    assert __version__ in capsys.readouterr().out


def test_module_entry_point_runs_without_the_console_script() -> None:
    completed = subprocess.run(
        [sys.executable, "-m", "keelline", "--version"],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True,
        check=False,
    )
    assert completed.returncode == 0
    assert __version__ in completed.stdout
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run it to watch it fail**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/test_cli.py -v`
Expected: collection error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'keelline.cli'`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the errors and the minimal CLI**

```python
# src/keelline/__main__.py
from keelline.cli import main

raise SystemExit(main())
```

```python
# src/keelline/errors.py
"""Exit-code-bearing exceptions shared by every command (contract C5)."""


class KeellineError(Exception):
    """Base class; never raised directly."""


class Failure(KeellineError):
    """Findings or a failed operation: exit code 1."""


class Refusal(KeellineError):
    """A refusal or an internal error a caller must never read as permission: exit code 2."""
```

```python
# src/keelline/cli.py
"""The CLI frame (contract C5): one parser, three exit codes."""

from __future__ import annotations

import argparse
import sys
from collections.abc import Callable, Iterable
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

import keelline
from keelline.errors import Failure, Refusal

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    SubParsers = argparse._SubParsersAction[argparse.ArgumentParser]
else:
    # Generic only in typeshed: subscripting the class at runtime raises TypeError.
    SubParsers = argparse._SubParsersAction

Registrar = Callable[[SubParsers], None]


def build_parser(registrars: Iterable[Registrar] = ()) -> argparse.ArgumentParser:
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog="keelline", description=keelline.__doc__)
    parser.add_argument("--version", action="version", version=f"keelline {keelline.__version__}")
    groups = parser.add_subparsers(dest="group", metavar="<group>")
    for register in registrars:
        register(groups)
    return parser


def main(argv: list[str] | None = None) -> int:
    parser = build_parser()
    args = parser.parse_args(argv)
    if getattr(args, "func", None) is None:
        parser.print_help()
        return 2
    try:
        return int(args.func(args))
    except Refusal as exc:
        print(f"keelline: refused: {exc}", file=sys.stderr)
        return 2
    except Failure as exc:
        print(f"keelline: failed: {exc}", file=sys.stderr)
        return 1
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests to watch them pass, and the gates**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/test_cli.py -v`
Expected: 2 passed. Then `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy`; fix anything reported before committing. Prove the alias guard matters: replace the `else:` branch's assignment with `SubParsers = argparse._SubParsersAction[argparse.ArgumentParser]` and run `uv run python -c "import keelline.cli"`; Expected: `TypeError: type '_SubParsersAction' is not subscriptable`; restore.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add -A && git commit -q -m "feat: package skeleton with the CLI frame and --version"
```

### Task 2: The stdlib-only import boundary

**Files:**
- Test: `tests/test_import_boundary.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: the invariant every later lane inherits — a module under `src/keelline/` importing outside the standard library and the package itself reddens this test on every interpreter in the CI matrix (Task 10), so a module that is stdlib on 3.13 but not on 3.11 is caught at the floor.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the test**

```python
# tests/test_import_boundary.py
"""Every runtime module imports only the standard library and keelline itself.

Hooks run under whatever python3 the wrapper finds, before any environment exists, so a
third-party import works on the developer's machine and fails inside a hook on the next one.
`sys.stdlib_module_names` belongs to the running interpreter, which is why CI runs this on
every supported version. Dynamic imports (`importlib.import_module`) are resolved by name
inside the package and are covered by the discovery tests, not by this walk.
"""

from __future__ import annotations

import ast
import sys
from pathlib import Path

SRC = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1] / "src" / "keelline"
ALLOWED = set(sys.stdlib_module_names) | {"keelline"}


def imported_roots(path: Path) -> set[str]:
    tree = ast.parse(path.read_text(encoding="utf-8"), filename=str(path))
    roots: set[str] = set()
    for node in ast.walk(tree):
        if isinstance(node, ast.Import):
            roots.update(alias.name.split(".")[0] for alias in node.names)
        elif isinstance(node, ast.ImportFrom) and node.module and node.level == 0:
            roots.add(node.module.split(".")[0])
    return roots


def test_runtime_modules_import_only_the_standard_library() -> None:
    offenders = {
        str(path.relative_to(SRC)): sorted(imported_roots(path) - ALLOWED)
        for path in SRC.rglob("*.py")
        if imported_roots(path) - ALLOWED
    }
    assert offenders == {}


def test_the_boundary_walk_sees_the_cli_module() -> None:
    assert (SRC / "cli.py") in set(SRC.rglob("*.py"))
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to watch it pass, then prove it discriminates**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/test_import_boundary.py -v`
Expected: 2 passed. Add the line `import pytest  # noqa: F401` to the top of `src/keelline/errors.py` and rerun; Expected: `test_runtime_modules_import_only_the_standard_library` reddens naming `errors.py` and `pytest`; remove the line and rerun to green. If it reddens for another reason the assertion needs redesigning.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/test_import_boundary.py && git commit -q -m "guard: pin the stdlib-only import boundary"
```

### Task 3: The preset and the configuration schema (C1, part one)

**Files:**
- Create: `src/keelline/presets/__init__.py`
- Create: `src/keelline/presets/recommended.toml`
- Create: `src/keelline/config/__init__.py`
- Create: `src/keelline/config/schema.py`
- Test: `tests/config/__init__.py`
- Test: `tests/config/test_schema.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: dataclasses `Keelline`, `Project`, `Paths`, `Memory`, `Budgets`, `NativeCaps`, `Ledger`, `Artifacts`, `Ci`, `CommitMessages`, `Personal`, `Config` in `keelline.config.schema`; `Budgets.effective(name) -> int` and `Budgets.overrides -> dict[str, int]`; `Paths.as_dict() -> dict[str, str]`; `keelline.presets.load_preset(name: str) -> dict[str, Any]`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the preset with the values §7.1 lists**

`hook_output_chars` is the cap S7 measured: exactly 10,000 characters per hook entry (10,000 stayed unspilled, 10,001 spilled), so the value below is measured, not merely documented. `memory_index_words` follows the enforced budget in ai-daybook, raised from 1,100 to 1,200 on 2026-09-05.

```toml

    return tomllib.loads(resource.read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing schema test**

```python
# tests/config/test_schema.py
from __future__ import annotations

import pytest

from keelline.config.schema import Budgets, NativeCaps
from keelline.presets import load_preset


def test_recommended_preset_carries_every_budget_and_cap_the_schema_knows() -> None:

    assert set(preset["native_caps"]) == set(NativeCaps.NAMES)


def test_effective_budget_is_the_minimum_of_preset_and_override() -> None:
    budgets = Budgets(
        preset={"memory_index_words": 1100, "agents_md_lines": 300},
        configured={"agents_md_lines": 250, "memory_index_words": 5000},
    )
    assert budgets.effective("agents_md_lines") == 250
    assert budgets.effective("memory_index_words") == 1100
    assert budgets.overrides == {"agents_md_lines": 250, "memory_index_words": 5000}


def test_unknown_budget_name_is_a_key_error() -> None:
    # The preset carries the name so that only the `NAMES` check can raise: with `preset={}`
    # the empty dict's own lookup raises the identical KeyError and the check is unfalsifiable.
    with pytest.raises(KeyError):
        Budgets(preset={"no_such_budget": 999}, configured={}).effective("no_such_budget")
```

`tests/config/__init__.py` is an empty file so pytest resolves the package.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run it to watch it fail**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/config/test_schema.py -v`
Expected: collection error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'keelline.config'`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the schema**

```python
# src/keelline/config/__init__.py
"""Configuration (contract C1): keelline.toml merged under a preset, typed and validated."""

from keelline.config.schema import Config

__all__ = ["Config"]

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests to watch them pass, then prove the clamp discriminates**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/config -v`
Expected: 3 passed. Change `min(value, self.configured[name])` to `self.configured[name]` and rerun; Expected: `test_effective_budget_is_the_minimum_of_preset_and_override` reddens on the `memory_index_words` assertion; restore. Then delete the two `if name not in self.NAMES: raise KeyError(name)` lines and rerun; Expected: `test_unknown_budget_name_is_a_key_error` reddens with `DID NOT RAISE`; restore. If either reddens for another reason the assertion needs redesigning.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add src/keelline/presets src/keelline/config tests/config
git commit -q -m "feat(config): typed sections, the recommended preset, and lower-only budgets"
```

### Task 4: The loader — merge under the preset, validate, reject (C1, part two)

**Files:**
- Create: `src/keelline/config/loader.py`
- Create: `src/keelline/config/machine.py`
- Create: `src/keelline/config/paths.py` (a one-line stub here; Task 5 writes the real module)
- Test: `tests/config/test_loader.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `keelline.config.loader.load(root: Path, *, machine: Path | None = None) -> Config`; `keelline.config.loader.ConfigError(Failure)`; `keelline.config.loader.CONFIG_FILE = "keelline.toml"`; `keelline.config.machine.machine_config_path(env: Mapping[str, str]) -> Path` honouring `KEELLINE_CONFIG` then `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/keelline/config.toml` then `~/.config/keelline/config.toml`. The loader calls `validate_paths` (Task 5) before returning, so a config that escapes the root never reaches a caller.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests to watch them pass, then prove the unknown-key check discriminates**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/config -v`
Expected: every loader test passes and `test_a_path_that_escapes_the_root_is_refused_by_load` xfails, because the stub cannot refuse anything; the marker is strict, so Task 5 must delete it when the real check lands. Write the typed stub `def validate_paths(config: object, root: object) -> dict[str, object]: return {}` in a new `paths.py` now, so the import resolves and this task's mypy gate passes, and Task 5 replaces it. The marker exists because this plan's Global Constraints require a task's tests to pass before its commit, which a knowingly red test cannot do; Task 6 marks its own forward reference to Task 8 the same way. Delete the two `unknown` lines in `_build` and rerun; Expected: `test_unknown_key_inside_a_section_is_rejected` reddens; restore. If it reddens for another reason the assertion needs redesigning.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/keelline/config tests/config/test_loader.py
git commit -q -m "feat(config): load keelline.toml under the machine config and the preset"
```

### Task 5: Path containment (C1, part three; shared with C2)

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/keelline/config/paths.py`
- Modify: `tests/config/test_loader.py` (remove Task 4's `xfail` marker)
- Test: `tests/config/test_paths.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `keelline.config.paths.contained(root: Path, relative: str, *, allow_final_symlink: bool = False) -> Path`; `keelline.config.paths.PathEscape(Refusal)`; `keelline.config.paths.validate_paths(config: Config, root: Path) -> dict[str, Path]`. The scaffold lane calls `contained` from `plan()` and `apply()`; the memory-engine lane passes `allow_final_symlink=True` for `paths.memory` and validates the link target itself (§9.1).

    target = root / candidate
    for ancestor in [target, *target.parents]:

        if ancestor.is_symlink() and not (allow_final_symlink and ancestor == target):
            raise PathEscape(f"{relative!r} passes through a symlink at {ancestor}")
    # Defence in depth: the two checks above already refuse every escape a path string can
    # express, so no mutation reddens a test through this line alone; it stays for the path
    # form nobody has thought of yet.
    resolved_root = root.resolve()
    resolved = target.parent.resolve() / target.name if allow_final_symlink else target.resolve()

        name: contained(root, relative, allow_final_symlink=(name == "memory"))
        for name, relative in config.paths.as_dict().items()
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests to watch them pass, then prove each pinned check discriminates**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/config -v`
Delete the `@pytest.mark.xfail(...)` line above `test_a_path_that_escapes_the_root_is_refused_by_load` in `tests/config/test_loader.py` first; the marker is strict, so leaving it in place turns the now-passing test into a failure.
Expected: 12 path tests pass and Task 4's escape test turns green. Two mutations, each restored before the next: remove the `".."` rejection; Expected: `test_dotdot_is_refused_even_when_it_resolves_inside_the_root` reddens while the other escapes stay refused by the resolve check. Remove the `is_symlink()` branch; Expected: `test_a_symlink_pointing_inside_the_root_is_still_refused` reddens (the resolve check cannot see an inside-pointing link) and `test_a_symlinked_intermediate_directory_is_refused` reddens on its message. If either reddens for another reason the assertion needs redesigning.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/keelline/config/paths.py tests/config/test_paths.py tests/config/test_loader.py
git commit -q -m "harden(config): contain every configured path inside the project root"
```

### Task 7: The hook dispatcher interface and a reference dispatcher (C4)

**Files:**
- Create: `src/keelline/hooks/__init__.py`
- Create: `src/keelline/hooks/api.py`
- Create: `src/keelline/hooks/registry.py`
- Create: `src/keelline/hooks/dispatch.py`
- Create: `src/keelline/hooks/commands.py`
- Test: `tests/hooks/__init__.py`
- Test: `tests/hooks/test_dispatch.py`
- Test: `tests/hooks/test_hook_command.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces (fixed for every lane): `Policy` (`OPEN`, `CLOSED`); `HookEvent(name, session_id, agent_id, tool_name, tool_input, cwd, project_root, harness, raw)`; `HookResult(context=None, decision=None, reason=None)`; `Handler(name, event, policy, run)` where `run: Callable[[HookEvent, Config | None], HookResult]`; `Sink` protocol with `diagnostic(record: dict[str, object]) -> None`, `seen(key: str) -> bool`, `mark(key: str) -> None`, and `NullSink`; `registry.discover() -> list[Handler]` collecting every `keelline.<area>.hooks.register() -> list[Handler]`; `dispatch.dispatch(event, handlers, config, *, sink=NullSink(), cap=None) -> Outcome(exit_code, stdout, stderr, decision)`; `dispatch.parse_event(payload, env) -> HookEvent`; `dispatch.detect_harness(env) -> str`; `keelline hook <event>` reads the event JSON from stdin. The `hooks-core` lane supplies the real sink (diagnostics log, once-per-context markers), the wrapper and the per-harness emitter without changing these names.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing dispatcher tests**

The harness discriminator comes from the S1 record: Codex's hook launch sets `PLUGIN_ROOT` and `PLUGIN_DATA` alongside the `CLAUDE_*` names, and Codex's `SessionStart` stdin carries `model` and `permission_mode`. `detect_harness` keys on `PLUGIN_ROOT` first and on those two stdin fields second, never on `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` alone; `CODEX_HOME` and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` are not used because S1 could not attribute them to the harness. Codex's `PreToolUse` tool names were not measured (deferred), so nothing here depends on them.

```python
# tests/hooks/test_dispatch.py

    }

`tests/hooks/__init__.py` is an empty file. Every test passes an `env` that carries `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, so no test shells out to git.

Run: `uv run pytest tests/hooks -v`

Change `BLOCKING_EVENTS` to an empty set and rerun; Expected: both `PreToolUse` command tests redden; restore. If any reddens for another reason the assertion needs redesigning. Then the gates: `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy`.

### Task 8: Version discipline (C6) — `keelline release check`

**Files:**
- Create: `src/keelline/release/__init__.py`

- Create: `src/keelline/release/versions.py`
- Test: `tests/release/__init__.py`
- Test: `tests/release/test_versions.py`
- Modify: `tests/test_cli.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `keelline.release.versions.collect(root: Path) -> dict[str, str | None]` reading `pyproject.toml`, the package `__version__`, both plugin manifests and the top released changelog heading; `keelline.release.versions.check(root: Path) -> list[str]` returning mismatches and any marketplace entry carrying a `version`; the CLI command `keelline release check [--root PATH]`.

`tests/release/__init__.py` is an empty file. The changelog fixture carries an `## Unreleased` heading above the towncrier marker on purpose: the reader must take the first heading **below** the marker.

Delete the `@pytest.mark.xfail(...)` line above `test_areas_are_discovered_from_the_package` in `tests/test_cli.py`. Run: `uv run pytest -v`
Expected: all pass. Delete the `pending_fragments` `continue` branch and rerun; Expected: `test_pending_fragments_allow_the_changelog_to_lag` reddens; restore. Make `_read` return `None` unconditionally; Expected: `test_collect_reads_every_source_value` reddens on the first value; restore. Then the gates.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/keelline/release tests/release tests/test_cli.py
git commit -q -m "guard(release): one version string across package, manifests and changelog"

### Task 9: Plugin manifests and the launcher

**Files:**
- Create: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- Create: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- Create: `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- Create: `scripts/keelline`
- Create: `skills/.gitkeep`
- Modify: `pyproject.toml` (add `scripts/keelline` to `[tool.mypy] files`)
- Test: `tests/test_manifests.py`
- Test: `tests/test_launcher.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: the installable plugin; `scripts/keelline` runs the package from the plugin root without an installed wheel, refusing interpreters below 3.11 with a reason. Hooks invoke it as `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/keelline"` through the wrapper; skills never do (§5.1).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing manifest tests**

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to watch them fail**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/test_manifests.py tests/test_launcher.py -v`
Expected: the manifest tests fail with `FileNotFoundError` on the Claude manifest (4 failed, 1 passed — the `bin/` test passes) and the launcher tests fail with `FileNotFoundError` on the launcher.

  "owner": { "name": "Nezhinskiy" },

    }
  ]
}
```

`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "keelline",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "A methodology harness for coding agents: bug ledger, curated working memory, guards, and an adoption state machine.",
  "author": { "name": "Nezhinskiy" },
  "repository": "https://github.com/Nezhinskiy/keelline",
  "license": "MIT",
  "interface": {
    "displayName": "Keelline",
    "shortDescription": "Bug ledger, working memory, guards, and earned enforcement for coding agents",
    "developerName": "Nezhinskiy",
    "category": "Developer Tools"
  }
}
```

Create `skills/.gitkeep`, then the launcher:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Run Keelline from the plugin root, with no installed wheel required."""

import pathlib
import sys

if sys.version_info < (3, 11):  # noqa: UP036 - this check exists for older interpreters
    sys.stderr.write(
        "keelline: refused: python 3.11 or newer is required, found "
        f"{sys.version.split()[0]} at {sys.executable}\n"
    )
    sys.exit(2)

sys.path.insert(0, str(pathlib.Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1] / "src"))

from keelline.cli import main  # noqa: E402

raise SystemExit(main())
```

Save that as `scripts/keelline` and `chmod +x scripts/keelline`, then extend `[tool.mypy]
files` in `pyproject.toml` to `["src", "tests", "scripts/keelline"]`, which Task 1 left short
because mypy refuses a path in `files` that does not exist yet.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests, then the validator invocations S4 recorded**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/test_manifests.py tests/test_launcher.py -v`
Expected: every test passes (the old-interpreter test skips on a machine without one). Then the three validator invocations S4 showed to discriminate — the plugin-manifest path cascades into skills and agents, the marketplace path checks only itself, and the Codex manifest is reached only by its own path, where `--strict` is omitted because Claude Code's validator warns on Codex's `interface` field it does not know:

```bash
claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/plugin.json --strict; echo "rc=$?"
claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/marketplace.json --strict; echo "rc=$?"
claude plugin validate .codex-plugin/plugin.json; echo "rc=$?"
```

Expected: `rc=0` three times, the third with one warning about the unknown `interface` field. S4 measured that `"skills": "./skills/"` fails the third invocation with `Path not found`, because the value resolves relative to `.codex-plugin/`, and inferred `"../skills/"` as the remedy without re-running the validator against it — the spike record says so itself. Measured 2026-09-06 against `claude` 2.1.261: `../skills/` is refused as a path traversal attempt in both the string and the array form, `skills/` is refused too, and only omitting the key (or an empty list) validates. No value reaches the root-level `skills/` from inside `.codex-plugin/`, which is why the manifest above carries no `skills` key. A non-zero exit, or any warning on the first two, is a finding to fix in the manifest here, not to suppress. Then the gates: `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add .claude-plugin .codex-plugin scripts skills pyproject.toml \
  tests/test_manifests.py tests/test_launcher.py
git commit -q -m "feat: plugin manifests for Claude Code and Codex, and a floor-checked launcher"
```

### Task 10: Continuous integration for the Keelline repository

**Files:**
- Create: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: the check every lane's pull request runs on every supported interpreter; the `workflows` lane adds the reusable `check.yml` beside it later.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the workflow**

Pins are commit SHAs resolved on 2026-09-05 (`gh api repos/<repo>/git/ref/tags/<tag>`): `actions/checkout` v7, `astral-sh/setup-uv` v10.0.1, `actions/setup-node` v6. Re-resolve before the first push and update both the SHA and the comment together.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: ci

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python: ["3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1 # v7
      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@20cfd1bf945f4377ade1205e4dbc17946fc9a30d # v10.0.1
        with:
          enable-cache: true
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python }}
      - name: Install
        run: uv sync --locked
      - name: Lint and format
        run: |
          uv run ruff check .
          uv run ruff format --check .
      - name: Types
        run: uv run mypy
      - name: Tests
        run: uv run pytest -q
      - name: Version discipline
        run: uv run keelline release check
      - name: Build
        run: uv build

  plugin:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1 # v7
      - uses: actions/setup-node@249970729cb0ef3589644e2896645e5dc5ba9c38 # v6
        with:
          node-version: "22"
      - name: Install Claude Code for the plugin validator
        run: npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.261
      - name: Validate each manifest path
        run: |
          claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/plugin.json --strict
          claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/marketplace.json --strict
          claude plugin validate .codex-plugin/plugin.json
```

`claude plugin tag` is not run here: it creates `keelline--v<version>` and its dry run depends on which tags the checkout fetched, so it belongs to the release lane's explicit release step (§5.9).

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the same steps locally on every interpreter before pushing**

```bash
uv lock
for py in 3.11 3.12 3.13; do
  uv sync --locked --python "$py" && uv run --python "$py" pytest -q || exit 1
done
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy && uv run keelline release check && uv build
```

Expected: every command exits 0 and `dist/` holds a wheel and an sdist. `uv sync --python 3.11` installs the interpreter into uv's managed cache if it is absent; that cache is outside the repository and is not a write this plan tracks. Commit `uv.lock` with the workflow.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml uv.lock
git commit -q -m "chore(ci): lint, types, tests on 3.11-3.13, version discipline, manifest validation"
```

### Task 11: The plans directory, the copied P0 documents, and the installability check

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/plans/README.md`
- Create: `docs/plans/2026-09-05-agent-harness-p0-spikes.md`
- Create: `docs/plans/2026-09-05-agent-harness-foundation.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: the plan location every later lane writes to (`docs/plans/<date>-<slug>.md`), and the proof that the plugin installs from the checkout. The two P0 documents are **copied**: ai-daybook keeps its copies as the historical record its design trail registers, and the Keelline copies are authoritative from this commit on.

- [ ] **Step 1: Copy the two P0 documents from the ai-daybook branch and write the plans index**

```bash
mkdir -p docs/plans
SRC="${AI_DAYBOOK:-$HOME/Dev/ai-daybook}"
REF=$(git -C "$SRC" rev-parse --verify --quiet harness/agent-harness-foundation \
  || git -C "$SRC" rev-parse --verify --quiet spec/agent-harness-extraction \
  || echo origin/dev)
for name in 2026-09-05-agent-harness-p0-spikes 2026-09-05-agent-harness-foundation; do
  git -C "$SRC" show "$REF:docs/superpowers/plans/$name.md" > "docs/plans/$name.md"
done
cat > docs/plans/README.md <<'EOF'
# Plans

One implementation plan per work package, `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`, written against the
frozen design (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-05-agent-harness-extraction-design.md` in the
ai-daybook repository until the methodology docs move here). A plan's `Scope:` line names
the package it belongs to and the contracts it consumes and produces. The two P0 documents
were copied from ai-daybook, which keeps its own copies as history.
EOF
grep -nE '/Users/|/home/|Nezhinskiy' docs/plans/*.md \
  | grep -vE 'github.com/Nezhinskiy|"Nezhinskiy"|Copyright \(c\)' \
  || echo "the copied documents carry no home path and no stray login"
```

The branch name is read at run time because the ai-daybook branch may already have merged into `dev`; the executing branch is preferred over `spec/agent-harness-extraction` so that amendments made while this plan runs travel with the copy. `SRC` is written as a parameter expansion rather than a literal path because this plan is itself one of the copied documents, so a literal home directory here publishes the owner's account name. The last line scrubs **both** copied documents, not only the spike record: the earlier form greped the spike plan alone, and the one home path in the tree sat in this document, where nothing looked for it.

- [ ] **Step 2: Install the plugin from the checkout into a temporary configuration**

```bash
CFG=$(mktemp -d)
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$CFG" claude plugin marketplace add ~/Dev/keelline
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$CFG" claude plugin install keelline@keelline-marketplace
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$CFG" claude plugin list | grep -A3 keelline
grep -o '"installLocation": "[^"]*"' "$CFG/plugins/known_marketplaces.json"
/usr/local/bin/python3 ~/Dev/keelline/scripts/keelline --version
rm -rf "$CFG"
```

Expected: the list shows `keelline` enabled, `installLocation` names the checkout, and the launcher prints `keelline 0.1.0`. S2 measured that `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to that `installLocation` for a directory-sourced marketplace, so the file hooks and skills will run is the checkout's own launcher, which this step exercises directly. If the install refuses, Task 9's validator step names the manifest fix; apply it and rerun.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the full local check once more and commit**

```bash
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy && uv run pytest -q && uv run keelline release check
git add docs/plans && git commit -q -m "docs: plans index and the copied P0 documents"
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Ask, then create the GitHub repository and push**

Ask in chat: "Create the public repository `Nezhinskiy/keelline` now and push `main`? The push publishes the copied spike record, scrubbed of home paths and logins in Step 1." Only after a yes:

```bash
gh repo view Nezhinskiy/keelline >/dev/null 2>&1 \
  || gh repo create Nezhinskiy/keelline --public --description "A methodology harness for coding agents"
git remote get-url origin >/dev/null 2>&1 || git remote add origin git@github.com:Nezhinskiy/keelline.git
git push -u origin main
gh run watch --exit-status "$(gh run list --branch main --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')"
```

The repository creation is re-run-safe: an existing repository is reused. The first green CI run on `main`, together with Step 2 and Task 9's validator invocations, is the foundation package's exit criterion (§15.1): the plugin installs from the checkout, every manifest validates under `--strict`, and Keelline's CI passes on every supported interpreter.

| S3 | Claude Code docs: Hooks reference | living | 2026-09 | https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks | per-event exit-code semantics; the 10,000-character cap on each hook's output; `env` blocks in a committed settings file | the cap is stated verbatim on the page; a summarising fetch missed it twice and a raw read found it |
